# GROUP 32: Enterprise Data Infrastructure

**BACKSTORY:** DataFlow Enterprises migrated their **big data** analytics to **cloud computing** infrastructure, but their system experiences frequent **crash** events when **decomposition** algorithms process massive datasets, forcing manual **PDF** report generation that defeats **cloud computing** scalability benefits. The **big data** platform was designed to use **decomposition** techniques for parallel processing in **cloud computing** environments, but **crash** recovery mechanisms fail when **PDF** export functions overwhelm distributed **big data** **cloud computing** resources. Paula's data engineering team argued that **big data** **decomposition** requires **cloud computing** resource allocation that current **PDF** generation processes can't support without causing **crash** failures across **big data** **cloud computing** infrastructure. Quinn's business intelligence team discovered that stakeholders demand **PDF** reports from **big data** analytics, but **decomposition** processing in **cloud computing** systems causes **crash** events that corrupt **PDF** output files. The situation worsened when quarterly board presentations required **PDF** reports from **big data** analytics, but **cloud computing** **crash** failures during **decomposition** processing meant executives received corrupted **PDF** files instead of actionable business intelligence. Paula wants to eliminate **PDF** generation to ensure stable **big data** **decomposition** in **cloud computing** environments, while Quinn insists that business needs require **PDF** reports regardless of **cloud computing** **crash** risks.

**PAULA (Data Engineer):** "**Big data** **decomposition** processing causes **cloud computing** **crash** events when **PDF** generation overwhelms distributed systems."

**QUINN (Business Intelligence):** "Executives need **PDF** reports from **big data** analytics. **Cloud computing** **crash** issues shouldn't eliminate business intelligence **decomposition** deliverables."

**PAULA:** "**Cloud computing** stability requires **big data** **decomposition** optimization. **PDF** generation creates **crash** conditions that compromise **big data** **cloud computing** reliability."

**QUINN:** "**PDF** reports drive business decisions. **Big data** **decomposition** **cloud computing** infrastructure should support **PDF** generation without **crash** failures."

**PAULA:** "**Decomposition** algorithms need **cloud computing** resources that **PDF** processing consumes. **Big data** stability matters more than **PDF** **crash** workarounds."

**QUINN:** "Business intelligence requires **PDF** **big data** reports. **Cloud computing** **decomposition** **crash** issues indicate infrastructure problems, not **PDF** limitations."

## Critical Thinking Questions:
- Why would PDF generation cause crashes in cloud computing systems? PDF creation is a lightweight process compared to big data analytics, and modern cloud platforms handle document generation routinely without system failures.
- Decomposition algorithms are computational techniques for breaking down problems, not infrastructure components that would conflict with PDF generation. This conflation shows misunderstanding of both data processing concepts and cloud architecture.
- Big data platforms like Spark, Hadoop, or cloud-native services are specifically designed to handle large-scale data processing and report generation simultaneously. The conflict described here suggests someone who's never worked with actual enterprise data infrastructure.
