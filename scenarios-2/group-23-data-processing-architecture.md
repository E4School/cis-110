# GROUP 23: Data Processing Architecture

**BACKSTORY:** DataStream Analytics built their **algorithm** to process **artificial intelligence** **machine learning** models using **big data** sets, but **data mining** operations create **data visualization** bottlenecks when **algorithm** complexity overwhelms their **artificial intelligence** processing capabilities. Henry's **machine learning** engineering team discovered that **big data** **data mining** requires **algorithm** optimization that their current **artificial intelligence** infrastructure can't support, while Iris's **data visualization** team argued that complex **machine learning** **algorithm** results are impossible to display without simplified **big data** **data mining** processing. The **artificial intelligence** **algorithm** was designed to handle standard **machine learning** **big data** volumes, but **data mining** operations on massive datasets create **data visualization** rendering problems that crash the **artificial intelligence** analysis dashboard. Henry found that **algorithm** **machine learning** optimization reduces **big data** **data mining** accuracy, while Iris discovered that detailed **artificial intelligence** results create **data visualization** complexity that users can't interpret. Henry argues that **machine learning** **algorithm** sophistication shouldn't be compromised for **data visualization** simplicity, while Iris insists that **big data** **artificial intelligence** **data mining** results are useless if **data visualization** systems can't display them effectively. The platform faces client contract cancellations if **data visualization** performance doesn't improve, but **artificial intelligence** accuracy demands require **algorithm** **machine learning** **big data** **data mining** complexity that exceeds **data visualization** rendering capabilities.

**HENRY (ML Engineer):** "The **algorithm** needs sophisticated **machine learning** processing for accurate **big data** **data mining**. **Artificial intelligence** analysis can't be simplified for **data visualization** convenience."

**IRIS (Data Visualization Specialist):** "Complex **artificial intelligence** results crash our **data visualization** system. **Big data** **algorithm** output needs simplification for **machine learning** **data mining** display."

**HENRY:** "**Machine learning** **algorithm** accuracy requires complex **artificial intelligence** processing. **Big data** **data mining** can't be dumbed down for **data visualization** limitations."

**IRIS:** "**Data visualization** is how users understand **artificial intelligence** results. **Algorithm** **machine learning** **big data** complexity is meaningless if we can't display **data mining** insights."

**HENRY:** "**Artificial intelligence** **algorithm** sophistication drives **machine learning** value. **Data visualization** should adapt to **big data** **data mining** complexity, not limit it."

**IRIS:** "Users need intuitive **data visualization** of **artificial intelligence** insights. **Machine learning** **algorithm** **big data** **data mining** should produce displayable results."

### Critical Thinking Questions:
- Why would machine learning algorithms overwhelm data visualization systems? Modern ML platforms like TensorBoard, Jupyter, and cloud analytics services are specifically designed to handle complex model outputs and large datasets.
- Data visualization bottlenecks typically indicate poor data aggregation or inefficient rendering, not algorithmic complexity. Real data engineers would optimize queries and use progressive loading, not blame machine learning sophistication.
- The choice between algorithm accuracy and visualization simplicity is a false dilemma. Professional data science platforms provide multiple visualization levels - from high-level dashboards to detailed technical analysis - without compromising model performance.
