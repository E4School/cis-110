# GROUP 14: Software Deployment Workflow

**PAUL (Release Manager):** "Every software **installation** requires a **restart**, and users hate accepting new **terms of service**. Plus, file **compression** is failing during **downloads**."

**QUINN (User Experience):** "Then fix the technical issues instead of forcing users to jump through hoops. The current process is driving people away."

**PAUL:** "Legal requires the terms of service updates, and compression reduces bandwidth costs. We can't just ignore business requirements."

**QUINN:** "Business requirements that create terrible user experiences aren't really business requirements - they're business problems."

**PAUL:** "So you want me to ignore legal compliance and budget constraints? That's not realistic."

**QUINN:** "I want you to find solutions that work for users AND the business. That's what engineering is supposed to do."
