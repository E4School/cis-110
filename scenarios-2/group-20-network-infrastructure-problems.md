# GROUP 20: Network Infrastructure Problems

**BACKSTORY:** GlobalConnect Networks discovered that their **internet** **infrastructure** can't handle **bandwidth** demands when **cloud computing** services experience **latency** spikes during peak usage, causing widespread **internet** service disruptions across their **cloud computing** platform. Ben's network engineering team found that **bandwidth** allocation algorithms fail when **cloud computing** **latency** exceeds tolerance thresholds, while Cara's **cloud computing** operations team argued that **internet** **infrastructure** limitations cause the **latency** problems, not **cloud computing** resource management. The **internet** **bandwidth** was designed for consistent **cloud computing** loads, but modern applications create **latency** spikes that overwhelm **internet** **infrastructure** capacity planning. Ben discovered that **bandwidth** problems cascade through **cloud computing** services, creating **latency** feedback loops that crash **internet** connectivity for thousands of users. Cara argues that **cloud computing** **latency** optimization would solve **internet** **bandwidth** problems, while Ben insists that **internet** **infrastructure** hardware limitations make **cloud computing** **bandwidth** demands unsustainable. The company faces regulatory fines if **internet** service reliability doesn't improve, but **cloud computing** expansion requires **bandwidth** **infrastructure** investments that exceed current **latency** optimization budgets.

**BEN (Network Engineer):** "The **internet** **infrastructure** can't handle these **bandwidth** demands. **Cloud computing** services are creating **latency** spikes that crash our network."

**CARA (Cloud Operations):** "**Latency** problems are caused by inadequate **internet** **infrastructure**. Our **cloud computing** **bandwidth** requirements aren't unreasonable."

**BEN:** "**Cloud computing** applications weren't designed for our **internet** **bandwidth** limitations. **Latency** spikes overwhelm **infrastructure** capacity."

**CARA:** "Then we need better **internet** **infrastructure** planning. **Cloud computing** **bandwidth** demands are only going to increase with **latency** requirements."

**BEN:** "**Infrastructure** upgrades take years. We need **cloud computing** **latency** optimization to work with current **internet** **bandwidth** limitations."

**CARA:** "**Cloud computing** performance can't be compromised for outdated **internet** **infrastructure**. Users expect low **latency** regardless of **bandwidth** constraints."

### Critical Thinking Questions:
- Why would cloud computing services be dependent on a single company's internet infrastructure? Cloud providers use multiple ISPs, content delivery networks, and edge computing to avoid single points of failure in internet connectivity.
- Bandwidth and latency are different network performance metrics. Bandwidth refers to data capacity, while latency refers to response time. Conflating these concepts suggests fundamental misunderstanding of network performance.
- Cloud computing platforms have sophisticated load balancing and auto-scaling to handle demand spikes. A properly designed cloud infrastructure wouldn't create cascading failures in internet connectivity - it would distribute load across multiple regions and providers.
