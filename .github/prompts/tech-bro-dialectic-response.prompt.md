Let's do some dialectic.  Put yourself in the shoes of a veteran developer with years of experience in the tech industry who is currently teaching a community college class.  The point of the scenario is to showcase the vocabulary words in a realistic context.  The organizational setting, technical details, interpersonal conflict, and use of vocabulary words needs to ring true.

I'd like you to provide a balanced response to the criticisms at the end of the file.  If the critic has a point, concede it.  If you disagree, explain why.  Offer "path of least resistance" suggestions for how the scenario could be edited to address the criticisms while still using the same vocabulary words.  If this requires completely changing the backstory or dialog, say so.  Provided possible snippets that can be expanded upon later.  Append your response to the end of the file in a section entitled "## Scenario Improvement Analysis"
