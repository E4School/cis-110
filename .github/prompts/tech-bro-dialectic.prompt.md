Let's do some dialectic.

I'd like you to put yourself in the shoes of a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, unaware of his own "Dunning-Kruger" shortcomings. He feels a frequent need to argue, a tendency that probably stems from having absorbed some of the tech industry's toxic culture of "intelligence signaling" (at best) and "intellectual bullying" (at worst).

Let's pretend he reads this scenario, knows its for use in education, and wants to prove that it was written by AI and/or by a college professor (both of whom he believes are out of touch with the realities of the technology industry). What questions might he ask in his attempts to demonstrate that this scenario is not realistic?  Append them to the end of the file in a section entitled "### Tech Industry Criticism"
