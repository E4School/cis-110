# GROUP 3: Corporate IT Policy Dispute

**Vocabulary:** cloud applications, data classification, compliance policies, automated storage, data governance

**BACKSTORY:** MegaCorp's legal department discovered that employees are using unauthorized **cloud applications** for document collaboration, creating GDPR compliance risks due to unclear **data classification** and cross-border data transfers. David's IT team identified that sensitive customer information is being stored in unapproved SaaS tools without proper **compliance policies**, while **automated storage** systems are syncing this data across multiple jurisdictions. Lisa's legal team had been advising employees that standard **cloud applications** were acceptable for internal use, not realizing that **data governance** regulations require explicit controls for customer data processing. The problem escalated when a departing employee's cloud accounts contained customer PII distributed across dozens of **cloud applications**, all synchronized through **automated storage** without **data classification** controls. A GDPR audit revealed that **compliance policies** weren't being enforced consistently, and **data governance** frameworks lacked visibility into shadow IT usage. David wants to restrict unauthorized **cloud applications** and implement mandatory **data classification**, while Lisa argues that **compliance policies** education and flexible **data governance** would solve the problem without disrupting workflows.

**DAVID (IT Director):** "We have no visibility into what **cloud applications** employees are using. Customer data is scattered across unauthorized platforms without proper **data classification**."

**LISA (Legal Counsel):** "Employees need productivity tools for collaboration. We can't just block **cloud applications** without providing approved alternatives that support their workflows."

**DAVID:** "But they're processing customer PII in unsecured **cloud applications**. Our **automated storage** policies can't enforce **data classification** on external platforms."

**LISA:** "So train them on **compliance policies** and provide guidance on approved **cloud applications**. Don't just block everything and break productivity."

**DAVID:** "**Compliance policies** training takes months to implement. Meanwhile, customer data is being processed without **data governance** controls, and **automated storage** makes tracking impossible."

**LISA:** "Then implement graduated **data governance** controls instead of blanket restrictions. Help employees choose compliant **cloud applications** rather than forcing underground workarounds."
