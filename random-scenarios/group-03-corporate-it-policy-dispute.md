# GROUP 3: Corporate IT Policy Dispute

**Vocabulary:** cloud applications, data classification, compliance policies, automated storage, data governance

**BACKSTORY:** TechScale, a 500-employee fintech startup, discovered during their Series B compliance audit that employees are using unauthorized **cloud applications** for customer data processing, creating GDPR Article 6 lawful basis violations and cross-border transfer issues. David's IT team found that their current CASB solution only monitors sanctioned apps, missing personal **cloud applications** with customer PII that bypass corporate **data classification** controls. Lisa's legal team had approved productivity tools for internal use without conducting Article 35 DPIAs, not realizing that **compliance policies** require explicit technical controls for any customer data processing. The crisis escalated when a departing sales manager's personal Google Drive contained 10,000 customer records automatically synced through **automated storage** integrations, all lacking proper sensitivity labeling per their **data governance** framework. The compliance audit revealed that OAuth scope limitations weren't enforced, API security gateways were misconfigured, and **data classification** schemes weren't integrated with DLP policies. David wants to implement stricter **cloud applications** controls and mandatory sensitivity labeling, while Lisa argues that user education on **compliance policies** and approved collaboration tools would address **data governance** gaps without $200K in additional security tooling costs.

**DAVID (IT Director):** "Our CASB only covers sanctioned apps. Customer PII is scattered across personal **cloud applications** without proper **data classification** or DLP enforcement."

**LISA (Legal Counsel):** "We can't block productivity **cloud applications** that teams need for collaboration. The business impact would cost us more than compliance fines."

**DAVID:** "But we're processing customer data without Article 6 lawful basis in these **cloud applications**. Our **automated storage** policies can't enforce **data classification** on external OAuth integrations."

**LISA:** "Then let's implement graduated **compliance policies** training and provide approved **cloud applications** with proper API security gateways. We should have consulted IT security for DPIA assessments initially."

**DAVID:** "Training takes 6 months while our Q4 audit approaches. Meanwhile, **automated storage** sync clients are creating data residency violations, and **data governance** controls have no visibility into personal device usage."

**LISA:** "The business won't approve $200K for additional CASB licensing. Let's implement conditional access policies for **cloud applications** and require sensitivity labeling for customer data rather than blanket restrictions that drive shadow IT underground."
