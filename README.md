# CIS 110 Learning Goals

TODO: 
- Refactor Chapter 1:
  * Exam Questions -> Vocab -> Sentences -> Explanations -> Resources -> Etc.
  * Factor out vocab.
  * Structure the data
  * Nice textbook with wiki-style linkages between resources
- Repeat for other chapters
- Pull exam questions from YML files instead of old JSON
- Ensure that:
  * Learning goals are the source of truth
  * Everything "flows" from them, via a pipeline that is as automated as possible
    (My videos can be the non-automated part, as can some of my more informal content creation processes)
  * The whole thing is documented such that it can be done for other courses, learning goals can be changed over time, etc.
