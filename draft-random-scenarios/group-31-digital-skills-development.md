# GROUP 31: Digital Skills Development

**BACKSTORY:** EduTech Solutions designed a **digital literacy** training program that uses **loop** programming exercises to teach **cybersecurity** concepts, but their platform crashes when students access training materials through **HTTPS** connections, undermining **digital wellness** goals by forcing extended troubleshooting sessions. The **digital literacy** curriculum includes **loop** coding tutorials for **cybersecurity** awareness, but **HTTPS** certificate validation errors prevent students from accessing **digital wellness** modules that are supposed to teach healthy technology habits. Nathan's curriculum team argued that **digital literacy** requires hands-on **loop** programming to understand **cybersecurity**, even if **HTTPS** technical problems compromise **digital wellness** by increasing student frustration and screen time. Olivia's technical support team discovered that **HTTPS** configuration errors cause **loop** infinite loading when students try to access **cybersecurity** modules, violating **digital wellness** principles by forcing students to spend hours troubleshooting **digital literacy** platform problems. The crisis escalated when students complained that **digital literacy** **cybersecurity** training was causing anxiety and excessive screen time due to **HTTPS** **loop** errors, contradicting the program's **digital wellness** objectives. Nathan insists that **digital literacy** **cybersecurity** education requires technical **loop** exercises regardless of **HTTPS** platform issues, while Olivia argues that **digital wellness** must be prioritized over **digital literacy** curriculum complexity.

**NATHAN (Curriculum Designer):** "**Digital literacy** requires understanding **cybersecurity** through **loop** programming exercises. **HTTPS** platform issues shouldn't compromise **digital wellness** education goals."

**OLIVIA (Technical Support):** "**HTTPS** errors create **loop** loading problems that violate **digital wellness** principles. **Digital literacy** **cybersecurity** training is causing student stress instead of learning."

**NATHAN:** "**Cybersecurity** **digital literacy** demands technical understanding. **Loop** programming teaches concepts that **HTTPS** troubleshooting and **digital wellness** concerns can't replace."

**OLIVIA:** "**Digital wellness** means students shouldn't spend hours fixing **HTTPS** **loop** errors. **Digital literacy** goals are undermined when **cybersecurity** training creates technical frustration."

**NATHAN:** "**Digital literacy** education requires **cybersecurity** technical skills. **Loop** programming and **HTTPS** understanding are essential **digital wellness** components, not obstacles."

**OLIVIA:** "**Digital wellness** promotes healthy technology use. **HTTPS** **loop** errors contradict **digital literacy** **cybersecurity** education by creating negative learning experiences."

## Critical Thinking Questions:
- Why would HTTPS certificate errors cause infinite loops in educational content? Certificate validation is handled by the browser, not by application logic. This suggests fundamental misunderstanding of how web security protocols work.
- Digital wellness typically refers to balanced technology use and mental health, not technical troubleshooting skills. Conflating platform reliability with wellness concepts shows confusion about educational objectives.
- Teaching cybersecurity through loop programming doesn't make pedagogical sense - cybersecurity involves security concepts, risk management, and policy understanding, not necessarily programming loops. This approach suggests academic thinking disconnected from real cybersecurity education.
