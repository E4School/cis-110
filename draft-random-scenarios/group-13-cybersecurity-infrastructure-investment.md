# GROUP 13: Cybersecurity Infrastructure Investment

**MARCUS (CISO):** "We need better **malware** detection. The current **antivirus** software missed three attacks this month, and our **primary keys** were exposed."

**NINA (CFO):** "You're asking for another million-dollar security budget increase. Meanwhile, our **responsive design** team can't even get funding for basic **password** improvements."

**MARCUS:** "Web design is useless if hackers steal everything through compromised credentials. Security should be the top priority."

**NINA:** "Security is important, but so is actually having a business. If our website doesn't work properly, we lose customers faster than any hack could damage us."

**MARCUS:** "Short-term thinking. One major breach costs more than five years of security investments."

**NINA:** "And five years of overinvestment in security costs more than most breaches. We need balance."
