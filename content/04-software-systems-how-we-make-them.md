# Software Systems: How We Make Them

### Vocab
- System software vs Application software
- Software license (EULA, Proprietary, Open Source, Copyleft, Permissive)
- Shareware / Trial / Subscription (SaaS)
- Update / Patch
- Installation / Uninstall
- Dependency
- Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC): Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance
- Regression
- Usability vs Functionality
- Documentation / README
- Specification / Requirements
- Revision history / Versioning
- Tutorial / Guide
- Use case
- Stakeholder
- Neutral point of view (NPOV)
- Consensus (collaborative editing)

### Relational Sentences
- System software provides platform services that application software consumes, with both governed by software license terms like EULA, proprietary, open source, copyleft, or permissive models.
- Distribution models include shareware, trial, or subscription (SaaS), each affecting update and patch delivery cadence.
- Installation resolves each dependency while uninstall removes associated artifacts and may leave shared dependencies in place.
- The Software Development Lifecycle (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance) iterates to reduce regression risk when applying a patch or adding functionality.
- Teams balance usability vs functionality, sometimes deferring noncritical features to avoid introducing regressions late in maintenance.
- A specification records requirements from stakeholders while documentation and the README summarize implementation context.
- Tutorials and guides translate requirements and use cases into actionable learning for new contributors.
- Revision history tracks versioning so collaborative editing can reach consensus while preserving a neutral point of view (NPOV).

### Final Exam Questions and Answers
- **Explain the difference between system software and application software**  System software manages hardware/resources (OS, utilities); application software performs end‑user tasks.
- **Discuss the purpose of software licensing and identify common types**  Defines legal use/redistribution; types: proprietary EULA, GPL (copyleft), MIT/Apache (permissive), shareware/trial, subscription (SaaS).
- **Explain the difference between local apps and Web based apps**  Local: installed, offline capable, deeper hardware integration. Web: delivered via browser, easy updates, cross‑platform, relies on network.
- **Explain the role of the basic office suite applications and their relation to each other**  Word processor (documents), spreadsheet (tabular quantitative analysis), presentation tool (visual communication). They share data (embedding, linking) and common UI paradigms.
- **Troubleshoot common software installation and configuration problems**  Steps: verify system requirements, check network/firewall, validate checksum/signature, run installer logs, isolate conflicting processes, clean environment variables, re‑install dependencies.
- **Compare different operating systems and their strengths for various computing tasks**  Windows: broad hardware/software ecosystem. macOS: integrated hardware + creative software. Linux: server, customization, containerization. Mobile OS (iOS/Android): touch, sensor integration.
- **Evaluate software alternatives based on functionality, cost, and licensing requirements**  Build comparison matrix (features, TCO, support, extensibility, compliance). Select option meeting must‑have features with lowest risk/long‑term cost.
- **Explain the software development lifecycle and how it impacts end users**  Phases (requirements → design → implementation → testing → deployment → maintenance) influence stability, security, and responsiveness to user feedback; mature processes reduce regressions.
- **Explain how Wikipedia articles are written and edited**  Collaborative editing via MediaWiki; neutral point of view and verifiability policies; revision history + talk pages mediate disputes; consensus governs content.
