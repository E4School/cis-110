Malware that replicates by attaching to other programs

## Definition
A virus is a type of harmful software that can spread by attaching itself to other programs on a computer. These malicious programs can cause damage by corrupting files, stealing information, or disrupting system operations. Understanding viruses is important for protecting computers and data from cyber threats, emphasizing the need for antivirus software and safe internet practices.

As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I firmly believe that the concept of virus is absolutely crucial for students to learn. Viruses are a fundamental aspect of computer programming and cybersecurity, and any developer worth their salt should have a deep understanding of how they work and how to protect against them.

Ignoring the importance of viruses in the world of technology is like ignoring the existence of gravity in physics - it's simply not an option if you want to be taken seriously in this field. By learning about viruses, students can better understand the potential threats to their code and how to implement robust security measures to safeguard their projects.

In my opinion, any educational program that fails to prioritize teaching about viruses is doing a disservice to its students. It's not enough to just write code; developers need to be aware of the potential dangers lurking in the digital landscape and be prepared to defend against them at all costs. Virus education should be a core component of any programming curriculum, and those who fail to grasp its importance are setting themselves up for failure in the competitive world of technology.
