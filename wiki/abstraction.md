# Abstraction

Focusing on essential features while ignoring unnecessary details

## Definition
Abstraction is the idea of focusing on the essential features of something while hiding unnecessary details, so you can think and work at the right level. In computing it helps manage complexity, enable reuse, and make changes safely because parts interact through clear interfaces instead of depending on internal steps. Examples include using a map instead of the whole city, calling a function without seeing its code, working with a data type or class instead of raw memory, or accessing a service through an API.
