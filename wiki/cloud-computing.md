# Cloud Computing

Using remote servers over the internet for computing resources.

## Definition
Cloud computing refers to the practice of using remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than relying on local servers or personal devices. This allows for increased flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness for businesses and individuals. For example, popular cloud computing services like Google Drive and Dropbox provide users with the ability to access their files from any device with an internet connection.

Cloud Computing? Seriously? It's just a buzzword thrown around by tech companies to make themselves sound innovative and cutting-edge. I don't see why students need to waste their time learning about something so overhyped.

I mean, sure, it might be useful for some big corporations or tech giants, but for the average junior developer like myself, it's just a distraction from the real work of coding and building applications. I'd much rather focus on mastering programming languages and algorithms than wasting my time on some trendy concept that may or may not be relevant in the future.

And don't even get me started on the so-called experts who constantly talk about Cloud Computing like it's the holy grail of technology. It's just another way for them to show off their supposed intelligence and put down anyone who doesn't understand or agree with them. I'm tired of being made to feel inferior just because I don't buy into the latest tech fad.

In my opinion, students would be better off learning the fundamentals of software development and honing their problem-solving skills than getting caught up in the hype of Cloud Computing. Let's focus on what truly matters in this field and leave the meaningless buzzwords behind.
