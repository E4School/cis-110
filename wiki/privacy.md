Right to control personal information

## Definition
Privacy refers to the right to control personal information, such as data about one's identity, activities, and relationships. In the context of computing, privacy is crucial as it pertains to safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure. For example, ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to personal data stored on a computer system is an important aspect of privacy in technology. Understanding and upholding privacy principles are fundamental in maintaining trust and security in digital environments.

Privacy? Yeah, of course it's important for students to learn about. I mean, do they really think they can just go around sharing all their personal information without consequences? It's common sense, right? But no, these clueless kids probably think they're invincible online and can just post whatever they want without thinking twice.

I see it all the time, students oversharing on social media, not realizing the potential dangers of putting their whole lives out there for anyone to see. And don't even get me started on data privacy and security issues. These kids need to wake up and realize that their information is valuable and should be protected.

But no, instead of taking privacy seriously, they just brush it off as some boring topic that doesn't affect them. Well, let me tell you, it's only a matter of time before they learn the hard way that privacy is not something to be taken lightly. So yeah, teach them about privacy, make sure they understand the risks, and maybe we can start to see some more responsible behavior online.
