# Iteration

Repeating a process to improve or refine results

## Definition
Iteration in computing refers to the process of repeating a set of instructions or steps to achieve a desired outcome. This repetition allows for refining and improving results through gradual changes. For example, in programming, iteration is commonly used in loops to perform tasks multiple times until a specific condition is met. Understanding iteration is crucial in developing efficient algorithms, programs, and systems in the field of computer science.

As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that the concept of Iteration is absolutely crucial for students to learn. It is the backbone of software development and without a thorough understanding of it, one cannot possibly hope to succeed in this field.

Iteration allows us to continuously improve and refine our code, to test and debug it until it meets the desired standards. It is through iteration that we can spot mistakes, identify inefficiencies, and come up with innovative solutions.

Those who dismiss the importance of iteration are simply demonstrating their lack of understanding of the fundamental principles of software development. It is not enough to write code once and hope for the best - true mastery comes from being able to iterate, iterate, and iterate until perfection is achieved.

In a culture that values intelligence signaling and intellectual bullying, it is those who embrace iteration and are unafraid to admit their mistakes who will ultimately prevail. Iteration is not just a concept, it is a way of thinking and approaching problems that sets the true professionals apart from the amateurs.
