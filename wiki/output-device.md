# Output Device

Hardware that presents information to users (monitor, printer, speakers).

## Definition
An output device is any hardware component that receives data from a computer and presents it to users in a form they can understand. These devices convert digital signals from the computer into human-readable or perceivable formats.

## Common Output Devices

### Visual Output
- **Monitor/Display** - Shows text, images, and video
- **Printer** - Creates physical copies of digital documents
- **Projector** - Displays computer screen on large surfaces
- **LED Indicators** - Simple status lights and notifications

### Audio Output
- **Speakers** - Produce sound and music
- **Headphones** - Personal audio output
- **Sound Cards** - Process and amplify audio signals

### Tactile Output
- **Haptic Feedback** - Vibrations and force feedback
- **Braille Display** - Tactile text for visually impaired users
- **Vibration Motors** - Physical alerts and notifications

## Types of Displays
- **LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)** - Common flat panel displays
- **LED** - Light-emitting diode displays
- **OLED** - Organic LED with better contrast
- **E-ink** - Low-power displays for e-readers

## Print Technologies
- **Inkjet** - Liquid ink sprayed onto paper
- **Laser** - Toner fused to paper using heat
- **3D Printer** - Creates three-dimensional objects
- **Thermal** - Heat-sensitive paper printing

## Output Quality Factors
- **Resolution** - Number of pixels or dots per inch
- **Color Accuracy** - How well colors are reproduced
- **Refresh Rate** - How quickly display updates (for monitors)
- **Volume/Clarity** - Sound quality and loudness
