As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that learning Javascript is absolutely crucial for any aspiring programmer. It is the backbone of modern web development and without it, you simply cannot create dynamic and interactive websites.

I find it frustrating when I see fellow students disregarding the importance of Javascript and instead focusing on trendy languages or frameworks. It's like they're missing the whole point of programming – to create functional and user-friendly applications. Javascript is a fundamental language that every programmer should master before moving on to more advanced technologies.

In my opinion, any student who neglects to learn Javascript is setting themselves up for failure in the tech industry. It's not just about following the latest trends or impressing others with your knowledge – it's about understanding the core principles of programming and being able to apply them in real-world scenarios.

So, yes, Javascript is definitely important for students to learn. It may not be the most glamorous language, but it is essential for anyone serious about pursuing a career in software development. And if you disagree with me, well, you're just showing your own ignorance and lack of understanding of the industry.
