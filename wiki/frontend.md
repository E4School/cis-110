# Frontend

User-facing part of a web application

## Definition
The frontend refers to the part of a website or web application that users interact with directly. It includes elements like buttons, menus, and forms that allow users to navigate and use the application. Understanding frontend development is crucial for creating user-friendly interfaces and enhancing the overall user experience on the web. For example, when you visit a website and see a login screen or a search bar, you are interacting with the frontend of that site.

As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that learning Frontend development is absolutely crucial for students. In today's tech-driven world, having a solid understanding of Frontend technologies is essential for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites and applications.

Frontend development allows us to bring our designs to life and make them accessible to users across different devices and platforms. Without a strong foundation in Frontend development, students risk creating subpar user experiences that could negatively impact their projects and ultimately their careers.

However, I do acknowledge that Frontend development can sometimes be seen as less complex or "sexy" compared to Backend development. But in reality, both are equally important and should be given the same level of attention and respect.

In conclusion, students should prioritize learning Frontend development as it is a fundamental skill that will set them up for success in the tech industry. Ignoring or dismissing Frontend development as unimportant is a short-sighted and potentially detrimental mindset to have.
