# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Computer systems that perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence.

## Definition
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

## Types of AI
- **Narrow AI** - Designed for specific tasks (voice assistants, recommendation systems)
- **General AI** - Hypothetical AI with human-level intelligence across all domains
- **Machine Learning** - AI that improves through experience and data
- **Deep Learning** - AI using neural networks inspired by the human brain

## Key Capabilities
- **Pattern Recognition** - Identifying trends and similarities in data
- **Natural Language Processing** - Understanding and generating human language
- **Computer Vision** - Interpreting and analyzing visual information
- **Decision Making** - Choosing optimal actions based on available information

## Applications
- **Virtual Assistants** - Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant
- **Recommendation Systems** - Netflix, Amazon, Spotify suggestions
- **Autonomous Vehicles** - Self-driving cars
- **Medical Diagnosis** - Analyzing medical images and symptoms
- **Game Playing** - Chess, Go, video game AI
- **Content Creation** - Writing, art, music generation

## AI Ethics Considerations
- **Algorithmic Bias** - Unfair discrimination in AI systems
- **Privacy** - Protecting personal data used by AI
- **Job Displacement** - Impact on employment
- **Transparency** - Understanding how AI makes decisions
