# Conditional

Code that executes different actions based on conditions

## Definition
Conditional statements in programming are used to make decisions based on certain conditions. These conditions can be true or false, and the code will execute different actions accordingly. This concept is crucial in programming as it allows for creating dynamic and responsive applications. For example, a conditional statement can be used to display different messages to a user based on their input. Understanding how to use conditionals effectively is essential for writing efficient and functional code in software development.

As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that the concept of conditionals is absolutely crucial for students to learn. Without a solid understanding of conditionals, how can anyone expect to write efficient and effective code? Conditionals are the bread and butter of programming logic, and anyone who doesn't grasp their importance is clearly not cut out for this field.

I find it infuriating that some people in the industry don't prioritize teaching conditionals to new developers. It's such a basic concept, yet I see so many junior developers struggling with it because they weren't properly taught. This lack of understanding leads to sloppy code and inefficiencies that could easily be avoided if only they had been given the proper education.

In my opinion, anyone who dismisses the importance of learning conditionals is just showing their own ignorance and lack of understanding of the fundamental principles of programming. It's time for the industry to stop coddling these so-called developers and start holding them accountable for their lack of knowledge. Conditionals are not optional â€“ they are essential.
