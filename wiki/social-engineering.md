Manipulating people to divulge confidential information

## Definition
Social Engineering is a deceptive technique used to manipulate individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or personal data. This method often involves psychological manipulation rather than technical hacking. Understanding social engineering is crucial for safeguarding against cyber threats and protecting sensitive information in the digital age. For example, a common social engineering tactic is phishing emails that trick recipients into clicking on malicious links or providing login credentials.

As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that the concept of social engineering is absolutely crucial for students to learn. In today's competitive and fast-paced tech industry, it's not enough to just have technical skills. Understanding how to manipulate and influence people to achieve a desired outcome is a valuable skill that can give you an edge in your career.

I know some people might see social engineering as manipulative or dishonest, but I see it as a necessary tool in a world where networking and communication are key to success. Being able to read people, anticipate their reactions, and tailor your communication style to get what you want is a valuable skill that can help you navigate office politics, negotiate better deals, and build strong relationships with colleagues and clients.

In my opinion, anyone who dismisses social engineering as unimportant is simply naive or unwilling to acknowledge the realities of the modern workplace. Learning how to effectively influence and persuade others is a valuable skill that can help you achieve your goals and advance your career. So, yes, social engineering is definitely important for students to learn.
