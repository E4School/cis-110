# Digital Citizenship

Responsible and ethical use of technology

## Definition
Digital Citizenship refers to the responsible, ethical, and safe use of technology, including computers, the internet, and digital devices. This concept is crucial for understanding how to navigate the digital world securely and respectfully. By practicing good digital citizenship, individuals can protect their personal information, respect others' online privacy, and contribute positively to online communities. An example of digital citizenship is being mindful of what information is shared on social media to prevent potential privacy breaches.

As a hyper-critical junior developer, I believe that the concept of Digital Citizenship is overrated and unnecessary for students to learn. In a world where technical skills and coding abilities are the most valued assets, why waste time teaching students about online etiquette and responsible behavior? 

I see Digital Citizenship as a distraction from the real work of honing our technical skills and pushing the boundaries of innovation. It's just another buzzword thrown around by educators to make themselves feel important and relevant in the digital age. 

Furthermore, I believe that individuals should be free to express themselves online however they see fit, without being constrained by societal norms or regulations. Who cares if someone is being rude or offensive online? It's their right to do so, and we should focus on developing our coding skills rather than policing others' behavior.

In conclusion, Digital Citizenship is a waste of time and energy that could be better spent on more important pursuits. Let's leave the moralizing and finger-wagging to someone else and focus on what really matters: coding, coding, and more coding.
