# Encryption

Converting data into coded form to prevent unauthorized access.

## Definition
Encryption is the process of converting readable information (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using mathematical algorithms and secret keys. Only those with the correct decryption key can convert the data back to its original form.

## Purpose of Encryption
- **Confidentiality** - Keep information secret from unauthorized users
- **Data Protection** - Secure sensitive information during storage and transmission
- **Privacy** - Protect personal and business communications
- **Compliance** - Meet legal and regulatory requirements
- **Trust** - Enable secure online transactions and communications

## Types of Encryption

### Symmetric Encryption
- **Same Key** - Uses identical key for encryption and decryption
- **Fast Processing** - Efficient for large amounts of data
- **Key Distribution** - Challenge of sharing keys securely
- **Examples** - AES, DES, 3DES

### Asymmetric Encryption
- **Key Pairs** - Uses public and private key combinations
- **Public Key** - Can be shared openly for receiving encrypted messages
- **Private Key** - Kept secret for decrypting received messages
- **Examples** - RSA, ECC, Diffie-Hellman

## Common Uses
- **HTTPS Websites** - Secure web browsing and online shopping
- **Email** - Protecting email content from interception
- **File Storage** - Securing files on computers and cloud services
- **Messaging Apps** - End-to-end encryption for private conversations
- **Banking** - Protecting financial transactions and account information

## Encryption Strength
- **Key Length** - Longer keys generally provide stronger security
- **Algorithm Quality** - Well-tested, standardized algorithms preferred
- **Implementation** - Proper coding and configuration crucial
- **Key Management** - Secure generation, storage, and distribution of keys

## Breaking Encryption
- **Brute Force** - Trying all possible keys (computationally intensive)
- **Cryptanalysis** - Mathematical analysis to find weaknesses
- **Side-Channel Attacks** - Exploiting implementation flaws
- **Quantum Computing** - Future threat to current encryption methods
