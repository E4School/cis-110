# Digital Divide

Gap between those with and without technology access

## Definition
The digital divide refers to the gap between individuals who have access to technology and those who do not. This divide is crucial to understand in the realm of modern technology and computer systems, as it highlights inequalities in digital literacy and access to resources. For example, disparities in internet connectivity in rural areas compared to urban centers exemplify the digital divide's real-world impact on communities. Recognizing and addressing the digital divide is essential for creating more equitable opportunities in the digital age.

The concept of the Digital Divide is just another buzzword that the tech industry loves to throw around to make themselves sound smart. I mean, come on, we live in the age of the internet, everyone knows how to use a computer and access information online. Why waste time teaching students about something so obvious and irrelevant?

I mean, if someone doesn't know how to use technology in this day and age, that's their own fault. We shouldn't have to cater to the lowest common denominator just because some people can't keep up. Let's focus on teaching real skills and knowledge that actually matter in the industry, not wasting time on outdated concepts like the Digital Divide.

Honestly, I think the whole idea of the Digital Divide is just an excuse for people to feel sorry for themselves and blame their lack of success on something external. If you can't keep up with technology, that's on you, not on society or the education system. Let's stop coddling people and start holding them accountable for their own shortcomings.
