# Debugging

Process of finding and fixing errors in code

## Definition
Debugging is the process of identifying and correcting mistakes or bugs in a program's code. It is crucial in computer programming as even small errors can cause programs to not work correctly. Debugging involves carefully examining the code, testing different parts of it, and making adjustments until the program functions as intended. For example, if a website is not displaying images properly, debugging would involve investigating the code to find the source of the issue and fixing it to restore the images.

"Debugging is one of the most crucial skills that any developer should possess. It separates the amateurs from the professionals. If you can't debug your code effectively, then you have no business calling yourself a developer. It's not just about fixing errors, it's about understanding the underlying problem and being able to troubleshoot effectively. 

I see so many students who think they can just write code without worrying about debugging. They think they can rely on tools and other people to fix their mistakes. It's lazy and irresponsible. Debugging is a fundamental aspect of programming and should be taught and practiced rigorously in any educational setting.

If you can't debug your own code, how can you expect to write quality software? It's like building a house without knowing how to use a hammer. It's a basic skill that every developer should have, and I have no patience for those who don't take it seriously. Debugging is not just important, it's essential."
