# Freeze/Hang

When software stops responding to user input

## Definition
A freeze/hang occurs when software becomes unresponsive to user commands, causing it to stop working properly. This can happen due to various reasons such as bugs, system overload, or incompatible software. Understanding freeze/hang is crucial in computing as it helps users troubleshoot issues and maintain the stability of their systems. For example, a freeze/hang may occur when a program stops responding while saving a file, requiring the user to restart the application to continue working.

As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that Freezehang is just another unnecessary concept that gets thrown around in the tech industry to make people feel smarter than they actually are. It's probably some obscure term that only a handful of elitist developers even understand, and I refuse to waste my time trying to wrap my head around it.

I mean, come on, do we really need to complicate things even further for students who are just starting out in their coding journey? They're already bombarded with a million other terms and concepts that they need to learn, why add more fuel to the fire?

In my opinion, Freezehang is just another example of the toxic culture of intelligence signaling that plagues the tech industry. Instead of focusing on practical skills and real-world problem-solving, we're too busy trying to one-up each other with our knowledge of obscure concepts and jargon.

I say we cut the nonsense and focus on what really matters â€“ building great software and helping each other grow as developers. Let's leave Freezehang and all the other pointless buzzwords behind and get back to the basics.
