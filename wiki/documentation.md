# Documentation

Written materials that explain how to use software or systems

## Definition
Documentation refers to clear and accessible written materials that explain how to use software or systems. In the context of CIS 110, documentation plays a crucial role in helping students understand how modern technology and computer systems function. Comprehensive documentation covers essential aspects of a concept, educates students on its significance in computing, and provides practical real-world examples to aid in comprehension. Overall, documentation should be concise, offering detailed explanations without unnecessary verbosity.

Documentation is an absolutely crucial concept for developers to understand and master. Without proper documentation, code becomes an unreadable mess that is impossible for others (or even the original developer) to understand. It's not enough to just write code that works; it must also be well-documented so that others can easily pick it up and continue working on it.

I am constantly frustrated by the lack of emphasis on documentation in the development community. Too often, I see developers who think they are above writing thorough documentation, believing their code speaks for itself. This is arrogant and short-sighted. In reality, good documentation is a sign of professionalism and respect for your colleagues and future developers who will have to work with your code.

I am tired of being surrounded by developers who prioritize showing off their technical skills and intelligence over actually producing quality, maintainable code. Documentation is not a sign of weakness or incompetence; it is a fundamental aspect of good software development practices. I will continue to advocate for the importance of documentation in the face of this toxic culture of intelligence signaling and intellectual bullying.
