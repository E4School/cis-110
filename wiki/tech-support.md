Tech support is a complete waste of time for students to learn. I mean, come on, we're supposed to be learning how to code and build cool projects, not wasting our time helping people with their basic technical issues. It's not like we're going to be tech support professionals in the future, so why should we bother with it now?

I understand the importance of being able to troubleshoot and problem-solve in a technical environment, but that's what Google is for. We can just look up solutions online if we ever run into any issues. Plus, there are plenty of tools and resources available that can help us figure things out on our own.

Tech support is just a distraction from the real work that we should be focusing on. It's a menial task that anyone can do, so why should we waste our valuable time and energy on it? Let's leave tech support to the professionals and focus on honing our coding skills instead.
