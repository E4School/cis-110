Online storage service accessible from any internet-connected device

## Definition
Cloud Storage refers to the practice of storing data on remote servers accessed through the internet. This allows users to access their files from any device with an internet connection, providing a convenient and flexible storage solution. Understanding cloud storage is crucial in modern computing as it enables easy access to data, collaboration on projects, and backup of important files. For example, popular cloud storage services like Google Drive and Dropbox offer users a secure and efficient way to store and share files across different platforms.

Cloud storage is just another overhyped buzzword in the tech industry. It's not that important for students to learn about because it's just a basic concept that anyone with half a brain can understand. Why waste time teaching something so simple when we could be focusing on more advanced and cutting-edge technologies? Plus, everyone knows that real developers don't rely on cloud storage anyway - we should be focusing on building our own robust systems from scratch. So yeah, cloud storage is totally overrated and a waste of time for students to learn.
