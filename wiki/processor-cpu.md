# Processor (CPU)

The "brain" of the computer that executes instructions.

## Definition
The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the primary component responsible for executing computer program instructions. It performs the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output operations specified by instructions.

## Key Functions
- **Fetch** - Retrieves instructions from memory
- **Decode** - Interprets what the instruction means
- **Execute** - Carries out the instruction
- **Store** - Saves results back to memory

## Components
- **Control Unit** - Manages instruction execution
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** - Performs mathematical and logical operations
- **Registers** - Small, fast storage locations for immediate data
- **Cache** - Very fast memory for frequently used data

## Performance Factors
- **Clock Speed** - Measured in gigahertz (GHz)
- **Number of Cores** - Multiple processing units on one chip
- **Cache Size** - Amount of fast memory available
- **Architecture** - Design and instruction set
