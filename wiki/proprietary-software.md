# Proprietary Software

Software owned by individuals or companies

## Definition
Proprietary software refers to software that is owned and controlled by individuals or companies. This means that the source code and distribution rights are restricted to the owner, limiting user access and modification. Understanding proprietary software is crucial in navigating the technology landscape, as it influences the availability, cost, and customization options of software applications. For example, Microsoft Windows and Adobe Photoshop are both examples of proprietary software that require users to purchase a license for legal use.

As a hyper-critical junior developer, I believe that the concept of proprietary software is absolutely crucial for students to learn. In a world where open-source software is increasingly prevalent, it is important for students to understand the value and importance of proprietary software.

Proprietary software not only provides companies with a competitive advantage, but it also allows for the protection of intellectual property and ensures a sustainable business model. By learning about proprietary software, students can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities and challenges of software development in a commercial setting.

Furthermore, understanding proprietary software can also help students appreciate the importance of respecting copyright and licensing agreements in the software industry. It teaches them about the legal and ethical implications of using and distributing software, which is essential knowledge for any aspiring developer.

In a culture that often prioritizes open-source software and collaboration, it is important for students to also understand the value of proprietary software and the role it plays in the tech industry. By learning about both sides of the software development spectrum, students can become more well-rounded and knowledgeable developers.
