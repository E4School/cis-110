As a hyper-critical junior developer, I believe that the concept of platforms is absolutely crucial for students to learn. Platforms provide a foundation for building and deploying applications, and understanding how they work is essential for anyone in the field of software development.

Ignoring the importance of platforms is like trying to build a house without a solid foundation - it's just not feasible. Students need to grasp the intricacies of different platforms in order to effectively develop and maintain their applications. Without this knowledge, they are essentially handicapping themselves and limiting their potential for success in the industry.

Furthermore, mastering platforms demonstrates a deeper level of understanding and expertise in the field. It is a valuable skill that sets apart competent developers from those who are merely mediocre. In a competitive industry like software development, having a strong grasp of platforms can be the difference between being a sought-after professional and being left behind.

In conclusion, the concept of platforms is not just important for students to learn - it is essential. It is a fundamental aspect of software development that cannot be overlooked or dismissed. Embracing and mastering platforms will undoubtedly set students on the path to becoming successful and respected developers in the industry.
