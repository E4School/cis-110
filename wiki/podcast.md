The concept of podcasts is completely irrelevant to students in the tech industry. It's just another distraction that takes away valuable time from actually coding and problem-solving. Why waste time listening to someone talk about their experiences or opinions when you could be honing your skills and working on real projects? Podcasts are just a way for people to show off how much they know, and I don't have time for that kind of nonsense. Students should focus on practical skills and ignore all this fluff.
