# Algorithmic Bias - Related Concept Sentences

- Artificial Intelligence (AI): Algorithmic bias can emerge in AI systems when their decision-making patterns systematically favor or disadvantage certain groups due to biased training data, design assumptions, or deployment contexts.
- Machine Learning: Algorithmic bias often arises in machine learning models because they learn from historical data that may encode societal inequities, amplifying those patterns in predictions.
- Algorithm: Bias can be embedded in an algorithm’s objectives, features, thresholds, or constraints, leading to unfair outcomes even when the code functions as intended.
- Data: Biased, incomplete, or unrepresentative data is a primary source of algorithmic bias, shaping model behavior and performance across different populations.
- Data Mining: Data mining practices can introduce or reinforce bias by overemphasizing patterns that reflect existing disparities or by filtering out minority signals as noise.
- Analytics: Biased analytics pipelines—from metric selection to segmentation and interpretation—can produce misleading insights that drive inequitable decisions.
- Big Data: Large-scale datasets can mask minority group patterns and entrench historical bias at scale, making algorithmic bias harder to detect and correct.
- Digital Ethics: Algorithmic bias is a central concern in digital ethics, which provides frameworks for fairness, accountability, transparency, and governance to mitigate harm.
- Biometrics: Biometric systems, such as facial or voice recognition, are prone to algorithmic bias when accuracy varies across demographic groups due to skewed training data or sensor differences.
- Automation: When biased algorithms are automated, unfair decisions can be applied quickly and widely, increasing the urgency for bias audits, human oversight, and accountability mechanisms.
