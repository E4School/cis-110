As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that the concept of antivirus is absolutely essential for students to learn. In today's digital age, where cyber threats and malware attacks are rampant, understanding how to protect your computer systems and data is paramount.

I find it frustrating that some students may dismiss antivirus as basic or unnecessary knowledge. They may think they are too advanced or too smart to worry about such trivial matters. But in reality, ignoring the importance of antivirus can lead to disastrous consequences, such as data breaches, identity theft, and system crashes.

I believe that learning about antivirus is not just about protecting oneself, but also about being a responsible and knowledgeable member of the tech community. It's about understanding the risks and taking proactive measures to mitigate them.

In a culture where intelligence signaling and intellectual bullying are prevalent, I think it's important for students to humble themselves and recognize that there is always more to learn, even in seemingly simple topics like antivirus. It's not about showing off how smart you are, but about being practical and proactive in safeguarding your digital assets.
