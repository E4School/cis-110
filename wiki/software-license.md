# Software License

Legal agreement defining how software can be used

## Definition
A software license is a legal agreement that outlines the terms and conditions for using a specific software program. This agreement dictates how the software can be used, distributed, and modified. It is important in computing as it ensures that users understand their rights and restrictions when using the software. For example, some licenses may allow for free personal use but require payment for commercial use. Understanding software licenses is crucial for both users and developers to ensure compliance and protect intellectual property rights.
