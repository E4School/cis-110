# Intrusion

Unauthorized access to a computer system

## Definition
Intrusion refers to the act of gaining unauthorized access to a computer system, network, or data. This can lead to security breaches, data theft, or damage to the system. Understanding intrusion is crucial in protecting sensitive information and maintaining the integrity of computer systems in today's technology-driven world. For example, hackers may attempt to intrude into a company's database to steal customer information, highlighting the importance of implementing strong security measures.

As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that the concept of Intrusion is absolutely crucial for students to learn. Intrusion is all about understanding and preventing unauthorized access to computer systems or networks, and in today's digital age, cybersecurity is more important than ever.

Many students may not realize the potential consequences of a cyber intrusion until it's too late. Without a solid understanding of Intrusion, they leave themselves vulnerable to attacks from malicious hackers who could steal personal information, financial data, or even take down entire systems.

I believe that by teaching students about Intrusion, we are empowering them to protect themselves and their data in an increasingly connected world. It's not just about knowing how to code or build software â€“ it's about understanding the importance of security and taking proactive measures to safeguard against potential threats.

Intrusion may not be the most glamorous or exciting topic to learn about, but it is essential for anyone working in the tech industry. Ignoring the importance of cybersecurity could have serious consequences, and I believe that all students should be well-versed in the concept of Intrusion to avoid falling victim to cyber attacks.
