Web applications are just another overhyped buzzword in the tech industry. Students waste their time learning about them when they should be focusing on more important fundamentals like algorithms and data structures. Who cares about building fancy interfaces when you can't even solve a simple coding problem efficiently? Web applications are just a distraction from real programming skills, and anyone who thinks otherwise is just trying to show off their supposed intelligence. Students should prioritize mastering the basics before diving into trendy but ultimately superficial concepts like web applications.
