# Sync

Keeping files identical across multiple devices

## Definition
Sync, short for synchronization, refers to the process of ensuring that files are consistent and up-to-date across multiple devices. This means that changes made on one device are automatically reflected on all other devices connected to the same account. For example, when you edit a document on your laptop, the changes will be synced to your phone and tablet. Understanding sync is crucial for maintaining data integrity and accessibility in modern computing systems.

As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that the concept of Sync is absolutely crucial for students to learn. In today's fast-paced and ever-evolving tech industry, the ability to synchronize data and processes across different systems is essential for creating efficient and seamless user experiences.

Not only that, but understanding Sync also demonstrates a deeper level of technical knowledge and problem-solving skills. It shows that a developer is capable of managing complex interactions between various components, which is a valuable skill to have in any software development role.

I find it frustrating that some developers may dismiss Sync as a basic concept that doesn't require much attention. In reality, mastering Sync requires a combination of technical expertise, critical thinking, and attention to detail. It is not something that can be easily overlooked or brushed aside.

In a culture where intelligence signaling and intellectual bullying are prevalent, I believe that emphasizing the importance of Sync can help level the playing field and showcase the true skills and abilities of developers. It is a fundamental concept that should not be underestimated or undervalued.
