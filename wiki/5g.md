# 5G

Fifth generation of wireless mobile technology

## Definition
5G is the fifth generation of cellular networking that delivers much higher data speeds, much lower delay (latency), and the capacity to connect many more devices than 4G. It achieves this by using new, higher-frequency parts of the radio spectrum and denser networks of small antennas, and can reserve resources for specific uses (network slicing). For computing, 5G enables real-time and cloud-based applications—such as smooth 4K streaming, cloud gaming, AR/VR, telemedicine, smart factories and cities, and vehicle-to-vehicle communication—while boosting the Internet of Things and edge computing. Coverage and performance vary by location and frequency: higher bands are fastest but have shorter range and weaker indoor penetration.
