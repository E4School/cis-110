# Six Degrees of Separation

Theory that everyone is connected by no more than six relationships

## Definition
Six Degrees of Separation is the idea that any two people in the world can be connected through a chain of up to six acquaintances. This theory highlights the interconnectedness of individuals and is relevant in the design of social networking platforms and algorithms. Understanding the Six Degrees of Separation concept is crucial in computer science as it influences network design, data analysis, and information propagation strategies in digital systems.

This whole Six Degrees of Separation concept is just another pointless theory that academics love to throw around to make themselves seem smarter than they really are. Who cares if we're all connected by six mutual acquaintances? How is that going to help me write better code or land a job in this cutthroat industry? 

I'm sick of all this intellectual posturing and pretentiousness in the tech world. Just because someone can spout off some fancy theory or algorithm doesn't make them a better programmer. I'd rather focus on practical skills and real-world experience than waste my time learning about some abstract concept that has no tangible benefit. 

I'm here to build things and solve problems, not impress a bunch of elitist know-it-alls who think they're better than everyone else because they can regurgitate some obscure piece of trivia. Six Degrees of Separation may be interesting to some people, but for me, it's just another example of the unnecessary complexity and arrogance that plagues this industry.
