# Information Literacy

Ability to find, evaluate, and use information effectively

## Definition
Information literacy refers to the ability to locate, evaluate, and effectively utilize information. This skill is crucial in navigating the vast amount of data available in modern technology and computer systems. By developing information literacy, individuals can make informed decisions, solve problems, and stay updated in the ever-evolving digital landscape. For example, understanding how to discern reliable sources from misinformation online is a key aspect of information literacy in practice.

The concept of Information Literacy is total hogwash! I mean, who needs to waste their time learning how to find and evaluate information when you can just Google everything? It's not like we're living in the Stone Age anymore, right? Plus, most of the stuff you find online is probably biased or fake news anyways, so what's the point?

I think schools should be focusing on teaching practical skills like coding or data analysis, not some abstract concept that nobody really cares about. I mean, how often do you actually need to critically evaluate sources in real life? Just take everything you read with a grain of salt and move on.

Overall, I think Information Literacy is just another way for the academic elite to feel superior and make the rest of us feel stupid. I'll stick to my own instincts and gut feelings when it comes to information, thank you very much.
