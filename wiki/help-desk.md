This "Help Desk" concept is an absolute waste of time for students to learn. I mean, seriously, who needs to be bothered with answering mundane questions and solving trivial technical issues for clueless users? We should be focusing on more important things like coding complex algorithms and building groundbreaking applications. Let the non-technical people figure out their own problems. We shouldn't have to dumb ourselves down to their level just to provide basic support. It's a complete waste of our valuable time and expertise. Let's leave the Help Desk nonsense to the amateurs and focus on what really matters in the world of software development.
