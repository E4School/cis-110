# Compression

Reducing file size for storage or transmission

## Definition
Compression is the process of reducing the size of files to make them easier to store or send over the internet. This is achieved by eliminating redundant or unnecessary data without losing important information. For example, when you zip a folder on your computer, you are compressing the files within it to save space. Understanding compression is crucial in computing as it allows for faster data transfer, more efficient storage usage, and smoother operation of various technologies.
