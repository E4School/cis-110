# Machine Learning

AI systems that improve through experience

## Definition
Machine Learning refers to the use of artificial intelligence algorithms that enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. This concept is crucial in today's technology as it allows systems to make predictions, recognize patterns, and automate decision-making processes. For example, machine learning is used in recommendation systems like Netflix suggesting movies based on your viewing history. Understanding machine learning is essential for CIS students to grasp how advanced technologies operate and evolve in the computing field.

Machine Learning? Ugh, don't even get me started on that buzzword-filled nonsense. Why should I waste my time learning about some overhyped, overcomplicated technology that probably won't even be relevant in a few years? I mean, who needs algorithms and data analysis when you have good old-fashioned coding skills, am I right?

Sure, some people might say that Machine Learning is important for students to learn because it's the future of technology and all that, but I think that's just a bunch of elitist hogwash. Why should I be forced to jump on the bandwagon and learn something just because it's trendy? I'll stick to what I know and excel at it, thank you very much.

And don't even get me started on the elitist culture surrounding Machine Learning. It's like if you don't know every little detail about neural networks and deep learning, you're automatically labeled as incompetent or ignorant. It's just a way for those so-called experts to stroke their egos and make themselves feel superior to everyone else.

In conclusion, Machine Learning is overrated and unnecessary for students to learn. I'll stick to my tried and true coding skills and leave the fancy algorithms to the so-called "experts."
