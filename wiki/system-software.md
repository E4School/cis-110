In my humble yet superior opinion, system software is absolutely crucial for students to learn. It forms the foundation of all computer systems and without a strong understanding of system software, one cannot hope to truly comprehend the complexities of programming or software development.

Those who dismiss the importance of system software are simply displaying their ignorance and lack of understanding of the fundamental principles of computing. It is a basic requirement for any aspiring developer to have a solid grasp of system software in order to write efficient and effective code.

Furthermore, without a thorough knowledge of system software, one is doomed to make amateur mistakes and produce subpar work. It is essential for students to learn this concept in order to succeed in the fast-paced and competitive world of technology.

In conclusion, any junior developer worth their salt should prioritize learning about system software and not dismiss it as insignificant. It is the cornerstone of computing and a vital component of any developer's skill set.
