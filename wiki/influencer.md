Person with significant online following who can affect opinions

## Definition
An influencer is a person who has a large following on social media platforms and can impact the opinions and behaviors of their audience. They play a crucial role in modern digital communication by promoting products, services, or ideas to their followers. Understanding influencers is important in computing as they can drive online trends and marketing strategies, influencing the way information is spread and received online. For example, a beauty influencer may collaborate with a makeup brand to showcase their products to their followers, leading to increased sales for the brand.

As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that the concept of "influencer" is overrated and irrelevant in the world of technology and coding. In my opinion, students should focus on honing their technical skills and knowledge rather than wasting time trying to become an "influencer" in the industry.

I see the term "influencer" as nothing more than a superficial title given to those who have mastered the art of self-promotion and social media marketing. True expertise in coding and programming should be based on actual accomplishments and contributions to the field, not on how many followers one has on Instagram or Twitter.

Furthermore, I believe that the culture of "intelligence signaling" and "intellectual bullying" in the tech industry only serves to distract young developers from what truly matters - creating innovative solutions to complex problems. Instead of trying to impress others with their online presence, students should focus on building a strong foundation of technical skills that will set them apart in the competitive world of technology.

In conclusion, the concept of "influencer" is not important for students to learn. Instead, they should prioritize their education and practical experience in coding and programming to truly make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.
