# Absolute Path

Complete file location from the root directory

## Definition
An absolute path is the full, exact address of a file or folder starting at the root of the file system, so it always points to the same place no matter where you are. It typically starts with a drive letter and backslash on Windows (e.g., C:\Users\Alex\Documents\report.docx) or a leading slash on macOS/Linux (e.g., /home/alex/Documents/report.docx). Because it avoids ambiguity, absolute paths are widely used in scripts, configuration files, and troubleshooting to ensure the system can reliably locate resources.
