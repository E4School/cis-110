Digital Ethics? What a load of nonsense. I don't have time to waste on some fluffy, feel-good concept that doesn't have any real impact on my coding skills. I'm here to learn how to write efficient and effective code, not to debate about some abstract idea of ethics in the digital world.

Sure, it's nice to think about being a good person online and all that, but what does that have to do with programming? I don't see how learning about Digital Ethics is going to make me a better developer. I'd rather spend my time learning practical skills that will actually help me advance in my career.

Besides, who even decides what is ethically right or wrong in the digital realm? It's all subjective anyway. I'll stick to focusing on my technical skills and leave the moral debates to the philosophers. Let's leave the touchy-feely stuff out of the classroom and focus on what really matters - writing clean, efficient code.
