As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I can confidently say that troubleshooting is an absolutely essential concept for students to learn. In fact, I would go as far as to say that any developer who doesn't prioritize mastering troubleshooting skills is setting themselves up for failure in the industry.

Troubleshooting is not just about fixing bugs or resolving issues in code - it's about developing a mindset of curiosity, problem-solving, and resilience. It's about being able to think critically, analyze situations, and come up with creative solutions under pressure. These skills are crucial in the fast-paced, ever-evolving world of software development.

So, to all the students out there, I urge you to prioritize learning and honing your troubleshooting skills. Trust me, it will set you apart from the crowd and make you a highly sought-after developer in the competitive world of tech.
