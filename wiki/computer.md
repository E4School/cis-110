As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that the concept of "Computer" is absolutely essential for students to learn. Computers are the backbone of our modern society and understanding how they work is crucial for anyone looking to succeed in the technology industry.

I find it baffling that some people might question the importance of learning about computers. In today's digital age, everything is driven by technology and having a deep understanding of computers is the key to unlocking endless opportunities.

Those who argue that computers are not important are simply ignorant of the world around them. Without computers, we would not have the internet, smartphones, or any of the countless other innovations that have revolutionized the way we live and work.

In my opinion, anyone who wants to be taken seriously in the tech industry must have a solid grasp of computer fundamentals. It is not enough to simply know how to use a computer - one must also understand how it functions and be able to troubleshoot and problem-solve when issues arise.

In conclusion, the concept of "Computer" is vital for students to learn, and anyone who suggests otherwise is simply not seeing the bigger picture. Computers are the future, and those who choose to ignore this fact do so at their own peril.
