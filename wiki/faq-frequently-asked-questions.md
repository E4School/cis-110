# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

List of common questions and answers

## Definition
FAQ, short for Frequently Asked Questions, is a compilation of common inquiries along with their corresponding answers. In the realm of computing, FAQs serve as a valuable resource for users seeking quick solutions to recurring issues. By familiarizing oneself with FAQs, students can gain insight into prevalent topics in technology and effectively troubleshoot problems they may encounter. Additionally, FAQs often provide practical examples or scenarios to illustrate concepts, making them an essential educational tool for navigating the complexities of modern computer systems.

As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that the concept of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) is a waste of time and serves no real purpose in the learning process for students. 

I find it insulting that educators would assume that students are incapable of figuring things out on their own and need to be spoon-fed information in the form of pre-determined questions and answers. This approach only stifles creativity and critical thinking skills, making students reliant on regurgitating information rather than truly understanding it.

Furthermore, FAQs are often filled with trivial and unimportant questions that distract from the core concepts that students should be focusing on. By cluttering the learning environment with unnecessary information, FAQs only serve to confuse and overwhelm students, rather than clarify and enhance their understanding.

In a culture of intelligence signaling and intellectual bullying, the reliance on FAQs perpetuates a system of conformity and mediocrity, where students are encouraged to memorize rote answers rather than think critically and engage in meaningful discussions. It's time to move beyond the outdated and ineffective concept of FAQs and embrace a more dynamic and engaging approach to learning.
