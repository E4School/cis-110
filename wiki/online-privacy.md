Online privacy is obviously important for students to learn about. I mean, come on, it's 2021, people! With the amount of personal information we share online these days, it's crucial to understand how to protect ourselves from hackers, data breaches, and all that scary stuff.

I just can't believe how many people are so careless with their online privacy. They just click on any link or download any app without thinking twice about where their data is going. It's like they have no idea how vulnerable they are to identity theft, scams, and all sorts of cyber threats.

Students need to be educated about the importance of online privacy so they can take control of their digital footprint and protect themselves from potential harm. I don't understand why some people don't see the value in learning about this stuff. It's basic common sense, really. But hey, I guess some people just don't care about their own security.
