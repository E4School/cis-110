As a hyper-critical junior developer, I believe that learning the concept of Portable Document Format (PDF) is absolutely crucial for students. PDF is a widely used file format that allows for easy sharing and viewing of documents across different operating systems and devices. It is a standard in the professional world and being proficient in creating and working with PDF files is a necessary skill in today's digital age.
