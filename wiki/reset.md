As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that the concept of Reset is absolutely crucial for students to learn. In the world of programming, mistakes are bound to happen, and being able to reset and start fresh is a valuable skill. 

Resetting allows us to learn from our mistakes and approach a problem with a fresh perspective. It encourages us to think outside the box and come up with new solutions. Without the ability to reset, we would be stuck in a cycle of frustration and stagnation.

Furthermore, learning how to reset also teaches students resilience and perseverance. It is important to be able to bounce back from failure and continue moving forward. Resetting allows us to do just that.

In a culture of intelligence signaling and intellectual bullying, it can be easy to feel pressured to always be right and never make mistakes. But the reality is that everyone makes mistakes, and it is important to embrace them as learning opportunities. Resetting is a powerful tool that can help us grow and improve as developers.

Overall, the concept of Reset is not only important for students to learn, but it is essential for success in the world of programming. It is a skill that will serve us well throughout our careers and help us navigate the challenges that come our way.
