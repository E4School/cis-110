Instant Messaging is a relic of the past, a technology that is outdated and irrelevant in today's fast-paced world of communication. Students should not waste their time learning such archaic tools when there are far more important skills to develop, such as coding languages and data analysis. Instant Messaging is just a distraction, a way for people to avoid real communication and hide behind screens. Students should focus on developing their verbal and written communication skills, not on mastering a dying form of communication.
