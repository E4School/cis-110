# RAM (Random Access Memory)

Temporary, fast storage for currently running programs.

## Definition
Random Access Memory (RAM) is a type of computer memory that temporarily stores data and programs actively used by the processor. Unlike storage drives, RAM allows for fast reading and writing of data in any order, enabling quick access to information needed for running applications. RAM is crucial for smooth and efficient multitasking on computers, as it provides the workspace for active processes to operate seamlessly.

Ram Random Access Memory is one of those basic concepts that everyone thinks is so important, but in reality, it's just a bunch of hype. I mean, sure, it's useful to know how RAM works in a computer, but do students really need to spend so much time learning about it? It's not like they're going to be building computers from scratch or anything.

I think this obsession with RAM is just a way for the so-called "experts" in the industry to show off how much they know. They love throwing around technical terms like RAM to make themselves sound smart, but in reality, it's all just a bunch of nonsense. I mean, how often are students going to need to know the ins and outs of RAM in their day-to-day work? Probably never.

Instead of wasting time on trivial things like RAM, students should be focusing on more practical skills that will actually help them in their careers. I'm tired of this culture of intelligence signaling and intellectual bullying where people think they're better than everyone else just because they know some technical jargon. RAM Random Access Memory is just another example of this nonsense.
