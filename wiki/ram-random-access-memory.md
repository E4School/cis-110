# RAM (Random Access Memory)

Temporary, fast storage for currently running programs.

## Definition
Random Access Memory (RAM) is a type of computer memory that provides temporary storage for data and programs that are currently being used by the processor. It allows data to be read and written quickly in any order.

## Key Characteristics
- **Volatile** - Data is lost when power is turned off
- **Fast Access** - Much faster than storage devices like hard drives
- **Random Access** - Any memory location can be accessed directly
- **Temporary** - Stores data only while programs are running

## How RAM Works
1. **Loading** - Programs and data are copied from storage to RAM
2. **Processing** - CPU retrieves instructions and data from RAM
3. **Execution** - Programs run using data stored in RAM
4. **Clearing** - RAM is cleared when programs close or computer shuts down

## Types of RAM
- **DDR4** - Current standard for most computers
- **DDR5** - Newer, faster standard
- **LPDDR** - Low-power version for mobile devices

## RAM vs Storage
- **RAM** - Temporary, fast, volatile, expensive per GB
- **Storage** - Permanent, slower, non-volatile, cheaper per GB

## Performance Impact
- **More RAM** - Can run more programs simultaneously
- **Faster RAM** - Improves overall system performance
- **Insufficient RAM** - Causes system slowdowns and crashes

## Related Terms
- [[Processor (CPU)]] - Uses RAM to store instructions and data
- [[Storage]] - Permanent storage that works with RAM
- [[ROM (Read-Only Memory)]] - Permanent memory for basic system instructions
- [[Computer]] - System containing RAM

## Common Sizes
- **4GB** - Minimum for basic computing
- **8GB** - Standard for most users
- **16GB+** - For gaming, video editing, professional work
