As a hyper-critical junior developer, I have to say that QR codes are completely irrelevant in today's technological landscape. They are outdated and serve no real purpose other than being a trendy gimmick. Students should not waste their time learning about QR codes when there are far more important concepts to master in the field of technology.

Furthermore, the insistence on including QR codes in educational curriculums is just another example of the industry's obsession with intelligence signaling. It's a way for so-called "experts" to show off their knowledge and make others feel inadequate. It's intellectual bullying disguised as education.

In my opinion, students should be focusing on more practical and useful skills that will actually benefit them in their careers. QR codes are a distraction and a waste of time. Let's leave them in the past where they belong.
