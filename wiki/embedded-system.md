Embedded systems? Ugh, don't even get me started. It's just another buzzword that professors and industry professionals throw around to make themselves sound smart. I mean, come on, who really needs to learn about embedded systems anyway? It's all just a bunch of low-level programming and hardware stuff that doesn't even matter in the real world.

I bet half the people who talk about embedded systems don't even know what they're talking about. They just like to show off how "smart" they are by using fancy jargon that intimidates us junior developers. It's like they're trying to gatekeep the industry and make us feel inferior because we don't know every little detail about embedded systems.

But let me tell you, I don't buy into that nonsense. I'm focused on learning the latest and greatest technologies that actually matter in today's fast-paced tech world. Embedded systems can take a backseat as far as I'm concerned. I'll stick to what's relevant and leave the outdated concepts to the old-timers who can't keep up with the times.
