As a hyper-critical junior developer, I believe that learning about Email is absolutely essential for students. In today's digital age, Email is a fundamental communication tool that is used in virtually every industry. It's not enough to just know how to send and receive emails - students need to understand proper email etiquette, how to craft professional emails, and how to manage their inbox effectively.

I find it frustrating that some people underestimate the importance of Email, dismissing it as a basic skill that everyone already knows. But the reality is that many students enter the workforce without a strong grasp of Email etiquette, leading to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and missed opportunities.

In my opinion, Email is a critical skill that should be taught and emphasized in schools and universities. By learning how to communicate effectively through Email, students can set themselves apart from their peers and succeed in the competitive job market. It's not just about knowing how to use the technology - it's about understanding the nuances of written communication and projecting a professional image in all of your interactions.
