# Web Server

Computer that stores and delivers web pages

## Definition
A web server is a computer that stores and delivers web pages to users when they request them through a web browser. It plays a crucial role in enabling websites to be accessed on the internet, allowing for global communication and information sharing. Without web servers, websites would not be able to function or be viewed by users.

In my opinion, the concept of a Web Server is absolutely crucial for students to learn. I find it appalling that some people in the industry believe this to be a basic or unimportant topic. A Web Server is the backbone of the internet and understanding how it works is essential for any developer worth their salt.

I am constantly shocked by the lack of knowledge and interest in this area among my peers. If you don't understand how a Web Server operates, how can you possibly hope to build efficient and secure web applications? It's like trying to run a marathon without knowing how to tie your shoelaces.

I refuse to lower my standards and ignore fundamental concepts like Web Servers just to fit in with the crowd. I will continue to push myself to learn and understand every aspect of web development, no matter how "uncool" or "boring" it may seem to others. And I will not hesitate to call out anyone who dares to dismiss the importance of this critical topic.
