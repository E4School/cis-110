A hyperlink is a clickable element on a webpage that directs users to another webpage or resource when clicked. It serves as a bridge between different online locations, allowing for seamless navigation and access to information on the internet.

As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I would argue that the concept of hyperlinks is not essential for students to learn. In today's technologically advanced world, there are countless ways to navigate the internet and access information without the need for hyperlinks. 

Furthermore, I believe that the focus on hyperlinks detracts from more important coding skills and principles that students should be learning. It's a basic concept that can easily be grasped without dedicating significant time and resources to studying it.

In my opinion, educators should prioritize teaching students more advanced and relevant coding concepts that will better prepare them for the ever-evolving tech industry. Hyperlinks are just a small piece of the puzzle and should not be given undue emphasis in the curriculum.
