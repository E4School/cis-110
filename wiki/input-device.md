# Input Device

Hardware that allows users to enter data (keyboard, mouse, touchscreen).

## Definition
An input device is any hardware component that allows users to enter data, commands, or instructions into a computer system. These devices convert human actions into digital signals that the computer can process.

## Common Input Devices

### Primary Input Devices
- **Keyboard** - Text and command input using keys
- **Mouse** - Pointing and clicking interface
- **Touchscreen** - Direct touch interaction with display
- **Trackpad** - Touch-sensitive surface for pointer control

### Specialized Input Devices
- **Microphone** - Audio input for voice commands and recording
- **Camera/Webcam** - Visual input for images and video
- **Scanner** - Converts physical documents to digital format
- **Graphics Tablet** - Precise drawing and design input
- **Game Controller** - Gaming input with buttons and joysticks

### Accessibility Input Devices
- **Voice Recognition** - Speech-to-text input
- **Eye-tracking** - Control using eye movement
- **Switch Controls** - Large buttons for limited mobility
- **Braille Keyboards** - Text input for visually impaired users

## How Input Devices Work
1. **User Action** - Person performs physical action (typing, clicking)
2. **Signal Conversion** - Device converts action to electrical signals
3. **Data Transmission** - Signals sent to computer via cable or wireless
4. **Processing** - Computer interprets signals and responds appropriately

## Connection Types
- **USB** - Universal Serial Bus (most common)
- **Wireless** - Bluetooth or WiFi connection
- **PS/2** - Older standard for keyboards and mice
- **Audio Jack** - For microphones and audio input

## Related Terms
- [[Output Device]] - Hardware that presents information to users
- [[Hardware]] - Physical computer components
- [[User Interface (UI)]] - How users interact with software
- [[Device Driver]] - Software that controls hardware

## Design Considerations
- **Ergonomics** - Comfortable for extended use
- **Responsiveness** - Quick reaction to user input
- **Accuracy** - Precise input recognition
- **Durability** - Long-lasting construction

## Evolution
Input devices continue to evolve with technology, from simple keyboards to advanced voice recognition and gesture control systems.
