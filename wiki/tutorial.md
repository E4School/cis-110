Step-by-step guide for learning a skill or process

## Definition
A tutorial is a clear and accessible step-by-step guide designed for beginner CIS students to learn a specific skill or process. It comprehensively covers essential aspects of the concept, helping students understand its importance in modern technology and computer systems. Tutorials are educational tools that provide practical real-world context or examples to aid in the learning process, all while maintaining a concise and informative format to facilitate understanding.

As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that tutorials are a waste of time and a crutch for lazy students who can't figure things out on their own. Real developers don't need hand-holding or step-by-step instructions â€“ they should be able to dive into the code and figure things out through trial and error.

Tutorials only serve to dumb down the learning process and create a culture of dependence on external resources. Students who rely on tutorials are never going to become truly skilled developers because they are just regurgitating information without truly understanding the underlying principles.

In my opinion, students should be encouraged to explore and experiment on their own, rather than following someone else's instructions. This is the only way to truly learn and grow as a developer. Tutorials are for amateurs, not serious programmers.
