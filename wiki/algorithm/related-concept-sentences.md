# Algorithm - Related Concept Sentences

- Pseudocode: Pseudocode is a language-neutral way to write down an algorithmâ€™s steps clearly before translating them into actual code.
- Programming: Programming is the act of implementing algorithms on a computer so they can be executed to solve problems.
- Code: Code is the concrete, language-specific expression of an algorithm that a computer can run.
- Computational Thinking: Computational thinking is the problem-solving mindset used to design good algorithms, including how to break problems down and reason about solutions.
- Decomposition: Decomposition breaks a complex problem into smaller parts, making it easier to design the overall algorithm from simpler sub-algorithms.
- Abstraction: Abstraction hides unnecessary details so an algorithm focuses on the essential steps relevant to solving the problem.
- Function: A function packages part of an algorithm into a reusable, named unit, helping organize and modularize the overall procedure.
- Loop: A loop expresses repeated steps within an algorithm, allowing efficient handling of repetitive tasks until a condition is met.
- Conditional: A conditional introduces decision points in an algorithm, choosing different steps based on whether a test is true or false.
- IPOS Model: The IPOS (Input-Process-Output-Storage) model frames how an algorithm takes inputs, processes them through defined steps, may store intermediate results, and produces outputs.
