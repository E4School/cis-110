# IP Address

Numerical address that identifies devices on a network

## Definition
An IP address is a unique set of numbers that identifies a device on a network, like a home or office network or the internet. It allows devices to communicate with each other and share information globally. For example, when you type in a website address like www.google.com, your device uses an IP address to connect to Google's servers and display the webpage. IP addresses are crucial for enabling communication and data transfer across the internet.

As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that learning about IP addresses is crucial for students in the tech field. It is a fundamental concept that forms the backbone of the internet and networking systems. Without a solid understanding of IP addresses, one cannot truly comprehend how data is transmitted and received over the internet.

Furthermore, knowing about IP addresses is essential for troubleshooting network issues and ensuring the security of systems. It is the basic building block for setting up networks, configuring devices, and identifying sources of communication.

In my opinion, any student aspiring to work in the tech industry must have a thorough understanding of IP addresses. It is not just a theoretical concept but a practical necessity for any developer or IT professional. Those who dismiss the importance of learning about IP addresses are simply showcasing their lack of foundational knowledge in the field.
