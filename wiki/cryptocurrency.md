Digital currency secured by cryptography

## Definition
Cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency that uses encryption techniques to regulate the creation of new units and secure transactions. It operates independently of a central authority, such as a government or bank, making it decentralized and often anonymous. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are examples of this technology, which plays a significant role in understanding the financial and security aspects of modern computer systems.

Cryptocurrency is just another overhyped trend that will eventually fizzle out. It's not worth wasting time learning about something so volatile and speculative. Students should focus on mastering the fundamentals of traditional finance and programming languages instead of chasing after the latest shiny object. Cryptocurrency is just a distraction from what really matters in the industry.
