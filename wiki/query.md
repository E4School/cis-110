Request for specific information from a database

## Definition
A query is a request for specific information from a database. It allows users to retrieve, filter, and manipulate data stored in the database. Queries are essential in data management and information systems as they enable users to access the data they need efficiently. For example, querying a database to find all customers who purchased a certain product.

As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that understanding the concept of a query is absolutely essential for students to learn. Queries are the backbone of database management and play a crucial role in retrieving and manipulating data. Without a solid grasp of queries, students will struggle to effectively work with databases and develop efficient applications.

Furthermore, mastering queries demonstrates a deeper understanding of database principles and showcases a student's ability to write complex and optimized code. This skill is highly valued in the tech industry and can set students apart from their peers in job interviews and professional settings.

In my opinion, failing to prioritize the learning of queries is a disservice to students and hinders their potential for success in the field of software development. It is crucial for educators to emphasize the importance of queries and provide ample opportunities for students to practice and refine their skills in this area.
