# Abstraction - Related Concept Sentences

- Programming: Abstraction is a core principle in programming that manages complexity by breaking systems into modules with clear interfaces, enabling encapsulation, reuse, and independent evolution of parts.

- Function: A function is an abstraction of a computation; its signature defines the contract you use, while the implementation details are hidden.

- Data Type: A data type (and especially an abstract data type) abstracts the representation of values and the operations allowed on them, so code relies on behavior, not on low-level memory layout.

- API (Application Programming Interface): An API is an abstraction layer over a service or component, exposing a stable contract so clients can use capabilities without knowing internal logic or infrastructure.

- Operating System (OS): An OS provides powerful abstractions over hardware—such as processes, files, and virtual memory—and exposes them through system-call interfaces.

- System Software: System software both provides and consumes abstractions, mediating between raw hardware details and higher-level application needs (e.g., loaders, compilers, runtime environments).

- Device Driver: A device driver abstracts the specifics of a hardware device behind a uniform interface for the OS, so applications can use devices without handling vendor-specific details.

- Database: A database abstracts data storage, indexing, and concurrency, letting you interact through data models and query languages (e.g., SQL) without managing on-disk structures.

- Cloud Computing: Cloud computing abstracts underlying infrastructure into service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), letting users provision and scale resources via APIs without managing physical hardware.

- Computational Thinking: Abstraction is a pillar of computational thinking, enabling problem decomposition, model formation, and reasoning at appropriate levels while suppressing irrelevant detail.
