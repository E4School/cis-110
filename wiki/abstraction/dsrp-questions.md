# Abstraction - Dsrp Questions

## Is it a System?
- Yes, Abstraction can be thought of as a system. It has interacting parts (e.g., intent, interface, hidden detail, invariants) that together produce a capability: representing and manipulating complexity at an appropriate level.
- Classification:
  - A system: it comprises components and processes that collectively “lift” or “hide” detail.
  - A part of a system: it functions as a component within larger practices (e.g., software architecture, scientific modeling).
  - A relationship between systems: it mediates interactions (e.g., via APIs) and maps between levels (e.g., model ↔ phenomenon).
  - A boundary between systems: it creates interfaces and demarcates implementation from usage.
  - A cognitive tool for understanding systems: it structures thought by foregrounding essentials and backgrounding details.
  - Something else related to systems: a design discipline and a representational mapping (model-to-world, interface-to-implementation).

## Distinctions
- What Abstraction is (as a system):
  - A disciplined focus on essential features while hiding unnecessary details.
  - A representational mapping that preserves relevant structure for a purpose (task-, role-, or domain-specific).
  - An interface-plus-contract that enables safe composition and reuse.
  - A level-of-description in a hierarchy, supporting “working at the right level.”
  - A complexity-management technique that stabilizes change by decoupling users from internal steps.
  - In computing: functions, data types, classes, modules, services/APIs; in science: models and idealizations; in math: structures defined by axioms; in design: affordances that hide mechanism.

- What Abstraction is not (outside its boundary):
  - Raw, uninterpreted detail or implementation minutiae irrelevant to the current purpose.
  - Mere omission or vagueness without preserved structure or contract.
  - A guarantee of performance or correctness beyond its stated invariants (abstractions can leak or be misapplied).
  - The concrete phenomenon itself; it’s a model or interface to it.
  - Arbitrary simplification without validation or alignment to use-cases.

## Systems
- Parts of Abstraction (internal composition):
  - Intent and scope: what is considered essential, for whom, and for what tasks.
  - Interface: the visible surface (operations, types, protocols).
  - Hidden mechanism: implementation details deliberately concealed.
  - Invariants/contract: guarantees and obligations (pre/postconditions, error modes).
  - Level and mapping: the abstraction layer and how it relates to lower/higher layers (refinement/realization).
  - Composition mechanisms: ways abstractions combine (parameterization, genericity, polymorphism).
  - Cost model: performance, space, latency, cognitive load; where leaks may occur.
  - Validation and tests: how the contract is enforced.

- Abstraction as a part of larger systems:
  - Software systems: architectures, modules, service boundaries, frameworks.
  - Scientific inquiry: modeling, idealization, dimensional reduction.
  - Data and information systems: schemas, views, ETL pipelines.
  - Human–computer interaction: UI affordances masking workflows.
  - Mathematics and logic: axiomatization, type systems.
  - Organizational design: roles and procedures as abstractions over people’s work.
  - Education: curricular scaffolds that stage complexity.

## Relationships
- Related systems and concepts:
  - Encapsulation and information hiding: mechanisms for implementing abstraction.
  - Modularity and composition: how abstractions assemble into larger wholes.
  - Generalization/specialization: moving up/down abstraction hierarchies.
  - Interfaces/APIs/protocols: primary carriers of abstraction boundaries.
  - Refinement/concretization: implementing or detailing an abstraction.
  - Polymorphism/parametricity: reusability across types or contexts.
  - Idealization/approximation: scientific and engineering counterparts.
  - Verification/testing: ensuring contracts hold despite hidden details.
  - Performance engineering: managing cost and leak risks.
  - Security: least privilege, attack-surface reduction via strict interfaces.

- Abstraction as a relationship:
  - Mapping relation: A abstracts B if there exists a purpose-preserving map f: B → A that forgets certain details while preserving task-relevant structure.
  - Interface relation: Users interact with implementation through a stable interface; dependencies flow to the interface, not internals.
  - Hierarchical relation: Layer L+1 depends on guarantees of L; L refines L+1’s operations into concrete steps.

- Tradeoffs (relationship dynamics):
  - Under-abstraction: users confront accidental complexity.
  - Over-abstraction: loss of signal, indirection costs, brittleness.
  - Mismatch: abstraction’s essential set doesn’t fit the task, causing leaks.
  - Temporal drift: stable interfaces vs evolving domains; versioning and compatibility.

## Perspectives
- From the perspective of Abstraction as a system:
  - What are my invariants and who are my users?
  - Which details are essential vs accidental for current purposes?
  - Where can I leak, and how costly are those leaks?
  - How do I compose with other abstractions safely?
  - What refinement paths implement me, and how do I validate them?
  - What is my cost model and how visible is it to users?
  - How will I evolve without breaking dependents (versioning, deprecation)?

- Perspectives of other systems on Abstraction:
  - User/developer: Does the interface match mental models and tasks? Is it learnable?
  - Implementer/maintainer: Can internals change safely behind the boundary?
  - Architect: Does it reduce coupling and enable composability at scale?
  - Performance engineer: Does it obscure critical costs or enable optimization hooks?
  - Security analyst: Does it minimize attack surface and enforce least privilege?
  - Scientist/modeler: Does the model preserve phenomena relevant to inquiry?
  - Educator/learner: Does it scaffold complexity appropriately across levels?
  - Product/UX: Does it hide complexity without hiding necessary control?
  - Compliance/audit: Are guarantees explicit and testable?

Not applicable:
- If treated purely as a relationship (mapping or interface), some “internal parts” questions are not relevant; the focus shifts to properties of the mapping (faithfulness, completeness, composability) rather than to components.
