# ROM (Read-Only Memory)

Permanent storage for basic system instructions.

## Definition
Read-Only Memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile computer memory that stores data permanently. It contains essential instructions needed to start the computer and cannot be easily modified during normal operation.

## Key Characteristics
- **Non-volatile** - Retains data even when power is off
- **Read-only** - Data can be read but not easily written or modified
- **Permanent** - Stores data that doesn't change frequently
- **Essential** - Contains critical system startup instructions

## Types of ROM
- **BIOS ROM** - Contains Basic Input/Output System instructions
- **UEFI ROM** - Modern replacement for BIOS
- **Firmware ROM** - Instructions for device operation
- **Boot ROM** - Initial startup instructions

## What's Stored in ROM
- **System BIOS/UEFI** - Basic hardware initialization
- **Boot Loader** - Instructions to start the operating system
- **Hardware Drivers** - Basic device communication instructions
- **System Configuration** - Hardware settings and parameters

## ROM vs RAM
- **ROM** - Permanent, slow, non-volatile, read-only
- **RAM** - Temporary, fast, volatile, read-write

## Modern ROM Types
- **EEPROM** - Electrically Erasable (can be updated)
- **Flash Memory** - Type of EEPROM used in modern systems
- **SSD** - Uses flash memory technology

## Related Terms
- [[RAM (Random Access Memory)]] - Temporary working memory
- [[Storage]] - Other types of permanent storage
- [[Processor (CPU)]] - Uses ROM for startup instructions
- [[Operating System (OS)]] - Loaded after ROM completes startup

## Importance
ROM ensures that essential system instructions are always available, even when other storage fails, allowing computers to start up reliably.
