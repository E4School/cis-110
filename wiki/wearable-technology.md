Electronic devices designed to be worn on the body

## Definition
Wearable Technology refers to electronic devices that can be worn on the body, such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, and augmented reality glasses. These devices are designed to enhance daily activities, monitor health metrics, or provide convenience through connectivity.

As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that Wearable Technology is a pointless concept that has no real value in the world of software development. I see it as just another trendy buzzword that people use to seem smarter than they actually are.

I think that students should not waste their time learning about Wearable Technology because it is just a passing fad that will soon be replaced by something else. Instead, they should focus on mastering the fundamentals of programming and software development that will actually be useful in their careers.

In my opinion, the emphasis on Wearable Technology in the tech industry is just a way for companies to show off how cutting-edge they are, without actually providing any real value to users. It's all about intelligence signaling and intellectual bullying, trying to make people feel inferior if they don't keep up with the latest trends.

Overall, I believe that students should ignore the hype around Wearable Technology and focus on learning practical skills that will truly benefit them in their careers.
