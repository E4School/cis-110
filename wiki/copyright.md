Legal protection for original creative works

## Definition
Copyright is a legal protection that gives creators the exclusive rights to their original works, such as software, music, or writing. Understanding copyright is essential in computing to respect intellectual property rights and avoid legal issues. For example, when using someone else's code in a project, it is important to ensure that you have the necessary permissions to avoid copyright infringement.

As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that teaching students about copyright is a waste of time. In today's fast-paced tech industry, who really cares about copyright laws anyway? We should be focusing on more practical skills like coding and problem-solving, not wasting our time on legal mumbo jumbo.

Sure, copyright may have been important in the past when people actually cared about intellectual property, but in today's digital age, everything is free for the taking. Why bother learning about copyright when we can just Google whatever we need and copy and paste it into our projects? It's not like anyone is actually going to come after us for using someone else's work without permission.

Besides, who has the time to worry about copyright when there are so many other things to learn in the tech world? I'd much rather spend my time honing my coding skills and building cool projects than wasting it on something as trivial as copyright law. Let the lawyers worry about that stuff â€“ it's not our problem as developers.

In conclusion, teaching students about copyright is a pointless exercise that only serves to distract us from more important things. Let's focus on what really matters in the tech world and leave the legal stuff to the suits.
