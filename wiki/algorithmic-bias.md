# Algorithmic Bias

Unfair discrimination in automated systems

## Definition
Algorithmic bias occurs when a computer system consistently gives unfair advantages or disadvantages to certain people or groups. It can come from biased or incomplete data, design and training choices, or the way results are used, and appears in real systems like hiring tools, loan approvals, facial recognition, and predictive policing. Reducing bias is essential for fair and accurate technology and involves checking performance across groups, improving and documenting datasets, increasing transparency, and adding human oversight and accountability.
