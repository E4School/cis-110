As a hyper-critical junior developer, I believe that learning video conferencing is absolutely essential for students in today's fast-paced, technology-driven world. In a professional setting, video conferencing is becoming increasingly common as companies embrace remote work and global collaboration. It allows for face-to-face communication without the need for physical presence, making it a crucial skill for students to master.

Furthermore, in a world where communication is key, being able to effectively communicate through video conferencing demonstrates professionalism and adaptability. It shows that you are tech-savvy and able to navigate the digital landscape with ease.

However, I do believe that the current education system may not be adequately preparing students for the realities of the modern workplace. There is a lack of emphasis on practical skills like video conferencing, and instead, students are focused on memorizing facts and figures that may not be relevant in the real world.

In conclusion, video conferencing is an important skill for students to learn as it prepares them for the demands of the modern workplace. It is a tool that can enhance communication and collaboration, and students who master it will have a competitive edge in the job market.
