# Programming

Process of creating instructions for computers.

## Definition
Programming is the process of designing, writing, testing, and maintaining computer programs. It involves creating step-by-step instructions that tell a computer how to perform specific tasks.

## Key Concepts
- **Algorithm** - Step-by-step procedure for solving a problem
- **Code** - Set of instructions written in a programming language
- **Syntax** - Rules and structure of a programming language
- **Logic** - Reasoning and decision-making within programs

## Programming Process
1. **Problem Analysis** - Understanding what needs to be solved
2. **Algorithm Design** - Planning the solution steps
3. **Coding** - Writing instructions in a programming language
4. **Testing** - Checking if the program works correctly
5. **Debugging** - Finding and fixing errors
6. **Maintenance** - Updating and improving the program

## Programming Languages
- **High-level** - Easier for humans to read (Python, Java, JavaScript)
- **Low-level** - Closer to machine language (Assembly, C)
- **Interpreted** - Executed line by line (Python, JavaScript)
- **Compiled** - Translated to machine code before execution (C++, Java)

- [[Bug]] - Error in computer code
- [[Debugging]] - Process of finding and fixing code errors
- [[Function]] - Reusable block of code

## Applications
Programming is used to create everything from simple calculators to complex operating systems, websites, mobile apps, and artificial intelligence systems.
