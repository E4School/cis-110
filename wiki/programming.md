# Programming

Process of creating instructions for computers.

## Definition
Programming is the foundational process of creating computer programs by designing, writing, testing, and maintaining sets of instructions that enable computers to execute specific tasks. These instructions are written in programming languages such as Python, Java, or C++, which serve as the medium for communicating with computers. Understanding programming is essential for CIS students as it forms the basis of software development and problem-solving in the field of computing. For example, programming is used to develop applications, websites, and algorithms that drive technological advancements in various industries.

In my opinion, programming is absolutely essential for students to learn. It is the foundation of technology and innovation in our modern world, and without a solid understanding of programming, students will be left behind in a rapidly advancing digital landscape.

Programming teaches critical thinking, problem-solving, and logic skills that are transferable to all areas of life. It allows individuals to create their own solutions to problems, rather than relying on pre-existing tools or systems. In today's competitive job market, having programming skills can set students apart from their peers and open up a wide range of career opportunities.

Furthermore, as technology continues to evolve, understanding programming will become increasingly important for individuals to navigate and thrive in a tech-driven society. Whether students pursue careers in software development, data analysis, or even fields outside of technology, having a basic understanding of programming will be invaluable.

In conclusion, programming is not just a valuable skill to have - it is a necessary one. Students who fail to learn programming risk being left behind in a world that is increasingly dependent on technology. So, in my opinion, programming should be a core part of every student's education.
