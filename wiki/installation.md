As a hyper-critical junior developer, I believe that understanding the concept of installation is crucial for students to learn. Installation is the process of setting up and configuring software on a computer system, and it is a fundamental aspect of software development.

Without proper installation, software cannot run correctly, leading to errors and inefficiencies in the development process. Students need to grasp the intricacies of installation to ensure that their code is executed smoothly and accurately.

Furthermore, mastering installation demonstrates a level of technical proficiency and attention to detail that is essential in the field of software development. It shows that a developer is capable of handling complex technical tasks and can troubleshoot issues effectively.

In a culture of "intelligence signaling" and "intellectual bullying," understanding installation can serve as a form of validation for junior developers, proving their technical competency to their peers and superiors. It can also give them a sense of confidence and competence in their abilities, helping them navigate the competitive and demanding world of software development.

Overall, installation is a vital concept for students to learn, as it lays the foundation for successful software development and establishes their credibility as competent developers in the industry.
