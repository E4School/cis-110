# Digital Certificate

Electronic document that verifies identity

## Definition
A digital certificate is an electronic document that confirms the identity of an individual, organization, or website on the internet. It is used to establish secure connections and verify the authenticity of parties involved in online transactions. For example, when you visit a website with "https://" in the URL, the digital certificate ensures that the website is legitimate and protects your data from being intercepted by malicious actors. Understanding digital certificates is crucial for maintaining cybersecurity and trust in modern computer systems and technology.
