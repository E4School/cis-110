Real-time delivery of media content over the internet

## Definition
Streaming is the process of delivering media content, like videos or music, over the internet in real-time. This means that the content is played as it is being downloaded, allowing users to watch or listen without having to wait for the entire file to download first. Streaming is essential for services like Netflix and Spotify, as it enables users to access a wide range of media instantly without the need to store large files on their devices.

As a hyper-critical junior developer, I have a strong opinion on the concept of streaming in programming. I believe that it is absolutely essential for students to learn about streaming because it is a fundamental concept that forms the backbone of many modern programming languages and technologies.

Streaming allows developers to process large amounts of data efficiently by breaking it down into smaller, manageable chunks that can be processed in real-time. It enables developers to work with data in a more dynamic and flexible way, leading to more efficient and scalable applications.

In my opinion, any student who neglects to learn about streaming is doing themselves a disservice and will struggle to keep up with the fast-paced and ever-evolving world of technology. It is crucial for aspiring developers to have a solid understanding of streaming in order to stay competitive in the industry and to be able to tackle complex problems with confidence.

Overall, I believe that streaming is a vital concept that students should prioritize in their learning journey, and anyone who dismisses its importance is simply showcasing their own ignorance and lack of understanding of the fundamental principles of programming.
