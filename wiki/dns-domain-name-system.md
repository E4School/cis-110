# DNS (Domain Name System)

System that translates domain names to IP addresses

## Definition
The Domain Name System (DNS) is like the internet's phonebook, translating human-readable domain names (like google.com) into computer-readable IP addresses (like 172.217.3.206). It plays a crucial role in enabling devices to communicate with each other across the globe by ensuring that when you type in a website address, you're directed to the correct server. Without DNS, navigating the internet would be like trying to find a needle in a haystack.

The Domain Name System (DNS) is just another one of those overhyped technologies that the industry pushes on junior developers to make them feel like they're learning something important. I mean, come on, how hard is it to remember a few IP addresses? Why waste time learning about DNS when you could be focusing on more valuable skills like coding or problem-solving?

Sure, maybe in a perfect world where everything works perfectly all the time, DNS might be important. But in reality, it's just a crutch for lazy programmers who can't be bothered to remember a few numbers. And don't even get me started on all the technical jargon and complexities that come with DNS. It's just unnecessary complexity that only serves to make the industry more exclusive and inaccessible to newcomers.

So, no, I don't think students need to waste their time learning about DNS. It's a pointless distraction that only serves to stroke the egos of so-called "experts" in the field. Let's focus on what really matters and leave DNS in the dust where it belongs.
