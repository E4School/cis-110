# Algorithm

Step-by-step procedure for solving a problem.

## Definition
An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions for solving a problem or completing a task. It provides a clear, unambiguous set of steps that can be followed to achieve a desired outcome.

## Key Characteristics
- **Finite** - Has a clear beginning and end
- **Definite** - Each step is precisely defined
- **Input** - Takes zero or more inputs
- **Output** - Produces one or more outputs
- **Effective** - Steps are simple enough to be carried out

## Algorithm Design Process
1. **Problem Definition** - Clearly understand what needs to be solved
2. **Analysis** - Break down the problem into smaller parts
3. **Design** - Create step-by-step solution
4. **Testing** - Verify the algorithm works correctly
5. **Refinement** - Improve efficiency and accuracy

## Types of Algorithms
- **Sorting** - Arranging data in order (alphabetical, numerical)
- **Searching** - Finding specific items in data collections
- **Mathematical** - Performing calculations and computations
- **Graph** - Working with networks and relationships
- **Machine Learning** - Algorithms that improve with experience

## Representation Methods
- **Natural Language** - Written in plain English
- **Pseudocode** - Structured English-like notation
- **Flowcharts** - Visual diagrams with symbols
- **Programming Code** - Implemented in programming languages
