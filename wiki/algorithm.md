# Algorithm

Step-by-step procedure for solving a problem

## Definition
An algorithm is a clear, step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or completing a task: it takes input, follows unambiguous rules, and produces output, independent of any specific programming language. Good algorithms are finite (they eventually stop), correct (give the right result for all valid inputs), and efficient (use reasonable time and memory), often balancing trade-offs among speed, memory, and simplicity. Everyday examples include unlocking a phone with a passcode, sorting contacts, or a map app finding the shortest route; in programs, algorithms are the plans that code carries out.
