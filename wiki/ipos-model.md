# IPOS Model

Input, Processing, Output, Storage - the four fundamental computer operations.

## Components

### Input
- Data and instructions entered into the computer
- Examples: typing on keyboard, clicking mouse, voice commands

### Processing
- Computer manipulates and transforms input data
- Performed by the CPU following program instructions
- Includes calculations, comparisons, and logical operations

### Output
- Results of processing presented to the user
- Examples: display on screen, printed documents, audio

### Storage
- Saving data and programs for future use
- Temporary storage: RAM (while programs are running)
- Permanent storage: hard drives, SSDs, cloud storage
