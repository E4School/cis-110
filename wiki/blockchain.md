# Blockchain

Distributed ledger technology

## Definition
Blockchain is a decentralized system that records transactions across a network of computers. Each transaction is stored in a "block," linked to previous blocks, forming a chain. This technology ensures transparency, security, and immutability in data storage and has applications beyond cryptocurrency, such as supply chain management and voting systems. Understanding blockchain is crucial for grasping the future of digital transactions and information security in modern computing.

As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that blockchain is an overhyped and overrated concept that is not essential for students to learn. I think that it is just a buzzword that people use to sound smart and impress others, but in reality, it is not as revolutionary or important as people make it out to be.

I believe that students should focus on learning more practical and useful technologies and concepts that will actually help them in their careers, rather than wasting their time on something like blockchain. I think that the emphasis on blockchain in the tech industry is just a way for certain people to show off their supposed intelligence and expertise, and it creates a toxic culture of intelligence signaling and intellectual bullying.

In my opinion, students would be better off focusing on mastering fundamental programming languages, algorithms, and software development practices, rather than getting caught up in the hype surrounding blockchain. I think that the obsession with blockchain is just a distraction from what really matters in the world of technology, and students should not feel pressured to learn about it just because it is trendy.
