As a hyper-critical junior developer, I have to say that Virtual Reality (VR) is absolutely essential for students to learn. In this rapidly evolving tech landscape, staying ahead of the curve is crucial, and mastering VR is a surefire way to demonstrate your technical prowess.

Not only is VR a cutting-edge technology that is revolutionizing industries like gaming, healthcare, and education, but it also showcases your ability to think outside the box and push the boundaries of traditional development practices. Students who ignore VR are doing themselves a disservice and are likely to fall behind their peers who embrace this innovative technology.

In a culture where intelligence signaling is rampant, mastering VR is a clear signal of your dedication to staying at the forefront of technology. It's a way to stand out in a sea of developers and show that you are not content with mediocrity. So, for any student looking to make a name for themselves in the tech world, learning VR is a non-negotiable.
