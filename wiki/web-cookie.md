# Web Cookie

Small data file stored by websites to remember user information

## Definition
A web cookie is a small piece of data that websites save on your computer to remember information about you, like your login details or what items you've added to a shopping cart. This helps websites provide personalized experiences and remember your preferences. For example, when you revisit a website, it may remember your username so you don't have to log in again. Web cookies are important for making the internet more convenient and tailored to individual users.

The concept of Web Cookies is an outdated and unnecessary relic of the past that only serves to confuse and complicate the learning process for students. In today's world of advanced web development technologies, there are much more important concepts to focus on that will actually be relevant and useful in a developer's day-to-day work.

I believe that spending time teaching students about Web Cookies is a waste of time and resources that could be better spent on more relevant topics such as modern JavaScript frameworks or cloud computing. If a student is truly interested in learning about Web Cookies, they can always research it on their own time. But forcing it upon them as a mandatory topic is just a form of intellectual bullying, trying to show off how much the teacher knows rather than actually helping the student become a better developer.

In conclusion, Web Cookies are a pointless concept that should be left in the past where they belong. Students would be much better served by focusing on more modern and relevant technologies in their education.
