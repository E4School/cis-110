As a hyper-critical junior developer, I believe that the concept of malware is absolutely crucial for students to learn. Malware is a constant threat in the digital world, and understanding how it works and how to protect against it is essential for anyone working in tech.

I find it baffling that some people in the industry don't see the importance of learning about malware. It's not just about being able to identify and remove malicious software from your own devices, but also about being able to prevent attacks on larger systems and networks.

In my opinion, anyone who thinks that learning about malware is a waste of time is just showcasing their ignorance and lack of understanding of the real risks that exist in the digital world. It's important to stay informed and educated about potential threats, and malware is definitely a big one that shouldn't be taken lightly.
