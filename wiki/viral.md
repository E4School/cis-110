As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that the concept of "viral" is essential for students to learn. In today's fast-paced digital world, understanding how something can go viral and gain widespread attention is crucial for success in the tech industry.

Learning about virality teaches students about the power of social sharing, word-of-mouth marketing, and the importance of creating content that resonates with a wide audience. It also helps them understand the dynamics of online communities and how trends can spread rapidly through the internet.

Ignoring the concept of virality would be a missed opportunity for students to learn valuable skills in marketing, content creation, and audience engagement. In my opinion, it is essential for aspiring developers to grasp the concept of virality to stay ahead in the competitive tech landscape.
