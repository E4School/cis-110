In this junior developer's perspective, the concept of chatbots is overhyped and overrated. He believes that chatbots are just a trendy tech buzzword that doesn't warrant the amount of attention it receives in the industry. He sees it as a shallow and superficial technology that lacks real innovation or complexity.

In his mind, focusing on chatbots is a waste of time for students who should instead be learning more fundamental and advanced programming concepts. He views it as a distraction from more important skills like algorithm design, data structures, and software architecture.

Furthermore, he believes that the emphasis on chatbots in the industry is just a way for companies to show off their supposed cutting-edge technology without actually delivering any meaningful value. He sees it as a way for developers to signal their intelligence by working on trendy projects that don't actually solve any real problems.

Overall, this hyper-critical junior developer dismisses the importance of learning about chatbots and sees it as a superficial and overhyped concept that distracts from more meaningful and valuable areas of study in the field of software development.
