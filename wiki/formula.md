As a hyper-critical junior developer, I believe that understanding formulas is crucial for students to learn. Formulas are the building blocks of programming and without a solid understanding of them, students will struggle to write efficient and effective code.

Formulae are not just simple equations to be memorized and regurgitated, they are the key to solving complex problems and optimizing code performance. By mastering formulas, students can streamline their coding process, improve their problem-solving skills, and ultimately become better developers.

In a culture that values intelligence signaling, knowing and understanding formulas is a way to showcase one's technical prowess and problem-solving abilities. It sets the good developers apart from the mediocre ones and demonstrates a deeper understanding of the underlying principles of programming.

In conclusion, formulas are not just important for students to learn, they are essential for any aspiring developer who wants to excel in the field. By mastering formulas, students can unlock the full potential of their coding abilities and stand out in a competitive industry.
