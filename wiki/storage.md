# Storage

Long-term data retention (hard drives, SSDs, cloud storage).

## Definition
Storage refers to computer components and systems that retain digital data permanently, even when the computer is turned off. It provides long-term data retention for programs, files, and the operating system.

## Types of Storage

### Physical Storage
- **Hard Disk Drive (HDD)** - Magnetic storage with spinning disks
- **Solid State Drive (SSD)** - Flash memory with no moving parts
- **Optical Drives** - CD, DVD, Blu-ray discs
- **USB Flash Drives** - Portable flash memory devices

### Cloud Storage
- **Online Storage** - Data stored on remote servers
- **Backup Services** - Automatic data protection
- **Sync Services** - Keep files updated across devices

## Key Characteristics
- **Non-volatile** - Data persists without power
- **Large Capacity** - Can store vast amounts of data
- **Permanent** - Data remains until deliberately deleted
- **Accessible** - Can be retrieved when needed

## Storage vs Memory
- **Storage** - Permanent, large capacity, slower access
- **RAM** - Temporary, smaller capacity, faster access
- **Purpose** - Storage for long-term, RAM for active use

## Performance Factors
- **Capacity** - How much data can be stored (measured in GB/TB)
- **Speed** - How quickly data can be read/written
- **Reliability** - How long the storage device will last
- **Cost** - Price per gigabyte of storage

## Storage Hierarchy
1. **Primary Storage** - RAM (temporary, fastest)
2. **Secondary Storage** - HDDs, SSDs (permanent, fast)
3. **Tertiary Storage** - Optical discs, tape backup (permanent, slowest)

## Related Terms
- [[File]] - Basic unit of data stored
- [[Folder (Directory)]] - Organization system for files
- [[Backup]] - Creating copies for protection
- [[Cloud Storage]] - Online storage services
- [[File Management]] - Organizing stored data

## Modern Trends
- **SSD Adoption** - Replacing traditional hard drives
- **Cloud Integration** - Combining local and online storage
- **Increased Capacity** - Growing storage needs and capabilities
