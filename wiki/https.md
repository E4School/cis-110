# HTTPS

Secure version of HTTP with encryption

## Definition
HTTPS, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, is a secure version of HTTP that uses encryption to protect data exchanged between a user's web browser and a website. This encryption helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card details, making online transactions and communication safer. For example, when you see a lock icon next to a website's URL in your browser, it means the connection is secure with HTTPS.

In my humble opinion, the concept of Https is absolutely crucial for students to learn. It's not just important, it's essential in today's digital world. Https ensures that the data being transmitted between a user's browser and a website is secure and encrypted, protecting sensitive information from prying eyes.

Any developer worth their salt should understand the importance of Https and strive to implement it in all their projects. It's not just a best practice, it's a basic requirement for any website that wants to be taken seriously in terms of security and data privacy.

Those who dismiss Https as trivial or unnecessary are simply demonstrating their ignorance and lack of understanding of modern web development practices. It's not about showing off or signaling intelligence, it's about doing things the right way and protecting users' data. Anyone who thinks otherwise is just plain wrong.
