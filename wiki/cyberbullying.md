This whole concept of cyberbullying seems like a waste of time to me. I mean, kids these days need to toughen up and stop being so sensitive. If someone is getting bullied online, they should just log off and ignore it. It's not like it's real life, right? Plus, the internet is a free-for-all, so what do you expect?

I don't see why students need to learn about cyberbullying. It's just a way for people to play the victim card and get attention. If you can't handle a little criticism or teasing online, then maybe you shouldn't be on the internet at all. It's not like cyberbullying is a serious issue like physical bullying or something.

Overall, I think this whole cyberbullying thing is blown way out of proportion. People need to stop being so soft and learn to deal with a little online negativity. It's just part of being on the internet.
