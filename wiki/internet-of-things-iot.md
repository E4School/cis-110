# Internet of Things (IoT)

Network of connected everyday objects

## Definition
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the network of everyday objects that are connected to the internet and can communicate with each other. This concept is crucial in modern technology as it allows for the automation and optimization of various tasks and processes. For example, IoT can include smart thermostats that adjust the temperature in a house based on the occupants' preferences. Understanding IoT is essential in computing as it demonstrates the increasing interconnectedness of devices and the potential for efficiency and convenience in our daily lives.

As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) is overhyped and not as important as people make it out to be. I see it as just another buzzword that tech companies use to make themselves seem innovative and cutting-edge.

In my opinion, students should not waste their time learning about IoT because it is just a passing fad. Instead, they should focus on mastering the fundamentals of programming and software development. IoT devices are just glorified gadgets that will soon be replaced by the next big thing.

I believe that the emphasis on IoT in the tech industry is just a way for companies to show off their technical prowess and intelligence, creating a culture of intelligence signaling that is not beneficial for true innovation. Students should not be swayed by this trend and should instead focus on building a strong foundation in computer science principles that will stand the test of time.
