# Router

Device that forwards data between computer networks

## Definition
A router is a device that helps connect different computer networks together. It directs data packets to their intended destinations, allowing devices to communicate with each other across the internet. Routers are like traffic cops for the internet, ensuring information gets to where it needs to go efficiently and securely. Without routers, our digital world wouldn't be able to function smoothly.

As a hyper-critical junior developer, I believe that the concept of a Router is absolutely crucial for students to learn. Without a solid understanding of how routers work, how can anyone claim to be a competent developer? Routers are the backbone of any modern web application, responsible for directing traffic and ensuring that users are able to navigate seamlessly through the different pages and components of a website.

I find it baffling that some developers try to downplay the importance of understanding routers, dismissing them as mere technical details that can be easily handled by libraries or frameworks. This kind of attitude only serves to perpetuate a culture of ignorance and laziness within the developer community.

In my opinion, students should be taught the intricacies of routers from day one. They should understand how routers work, how to configure them, and how to troubleshoot common issues that may arise. Only then can they truly consider themselves competent developers.

In conclusion, the concept of a Router is not just important for students to learn â€“ it is absolutely essential. Any developer who thinks otherwise is simply deluding themselves and setting themselves up for failure in the long run.
