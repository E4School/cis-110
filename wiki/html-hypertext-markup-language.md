# HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

Code used to structure web content

## Definition
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a coding language used to structure content on the internet. It allows web developers to create websites with text, images, links, and other elements. Understanding HTML is crucial for anyone looking to work in web development, as it forms the foundation of all webpages. For example, by using HTML tags like <h1> for headings or <p> for paragraphs, developers can organize and format content for users to view on their browsers.

As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that learning HTML is an essential foundation for any aspiring programmer. It is the backbone of the internet and understanding how to create and manipulate web pages using HTML is crucial for anyone looking to pursue a career in web development.

I find it frustrating that some students may dismiss HTML as outdated or unnecessary in the age of advanced frameworks and tools. They fail to see the importance of mastering the basics before diving into more complex technologies. HTML may seem simple, but it forms the building blocks of every website we interact with on a daily basis.

Furthermore, I believe that neglecting to learn HTML is a sign of laziness and a lack of dedication to the craft of programming. It is a fundamental skill that every developer should have in their toolkit, and to disregard it is shortsighted and irresponsible.

In conclusion, I am a firm believer in the importance of learning HTML for students, and I will continue to advocate for its inclusion in programming curriculums. It is a foundational skill that should not be underestimated or undervalued in the ever-evolving world of technology.
