# Cybersecurity

Practice of protecting digital systems and data from threats.

## Definition
Cybersecurity involves protecting computers, mobile devices, electronic systems, and data from malicious attacks. This includes using technologies, processes, and controls to defend against cyber threats like viruses, malware, and hackers. It's crucial in computing to ensure that sensitive information remains secure and that systems operate smoothly without disruptions. For example, implementing firewalls and encryption are common cybersecurity practices to safeguard digital assets.

As a hyper-critical junior developer, I believe that Cybersecurity is absolutely crucial for students to learn. In today's digital age, where data breaches and cyber attacks are becoming increasingly common, having a strong understanding of Cybersecurity is essential for protecting sensitive information and ensuring the integrity of systems.

I see so many students in the tech industry who focus solely on coding and building cool new applications, but neglect the importance of securing those applications from malicious actors. It frustrates me to no end when I see developers who don't prioritize security in their work, thinking that it's someone else's problem to deal with.

In my opinion, Cybersecurity should be a fundamental part of any tech education curriculum. Students need to learn about best practices for secure coding, how to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, and how to implement strong encryption protocols. Ignoring Cybersecurity is not only irresponsible, but it also reflects a lack of understanding of the real-world implications of our work as developers.

So yes, Cybersecurity is definitely important for students to learn, and anyone who thinks otherwise is simply not seeing the bigger picture. It's time for us to stop prioritizing intelligence signaling and start taking the security of our technology seriously.
