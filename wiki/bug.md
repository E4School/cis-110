# Bug

Error in computer code.

## Definition
A bug is an error, flaw, or unintended behavior in computer software or hardware that causes it to produce incorrect or unexpected results, or to behave in ways not intended by the developers.

## Types of Bugs

### Syntax Bugs
- **Syntax Errors** - Violations of programming language rules
- **Typos** - Misspelled commands or variable names
- **Missing Elements** - Forgotten semicolons, brackets, or parentheses

### Logic Bugs
- **Incorrect Algorithms** - Wrong problem-solving approach
- **Faulty Conditions** - Incorrect if/then statements
- **Loop Errors** - Infinite loops or incorrect iterations

### Runtime Bugs
- **Crashes** - Program stops working unexpectedly
- **Memory Leaks** - Program doesn't release used memory
- **Resource Conflicts** - Multiple programs trying to use same resources

### Data Bugs
- **Incorrect Input Handling** - Program can't process certain data
- **Data Corruption** - Information becomes damaged or altered
- **Type Mismatches** - Using wrong data types

## Common Causes
- **Human Error** - Programmers make mistakes
- **Complexity** - Large programs are harder to perfect
- **Time Pressure** - Rushed development leads to oversights
- **Changing Requirements** - New features introduce problems
- **Hardware Issues** - Physical component failures

## Bug Discovery
- **Testing** - Systematic checking of program functionality
- **User Reports** - Real-world usage reveals problems
- **Code Review** - Other programmers examine code
- **Automated Tools** - Software that finds common errors

## Impact of Bugs
- **Minor Inconvenience** - Small display issues or typos
- **System Crashes** - Programs stop working
- **Security Vulnerabilities** - Potential entry points for attacks
- **Data Loss** - Important information may be destroyed
- **Financial Cost** - Time and money spent fixing problems
