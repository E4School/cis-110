Suffix that indicates file type (.txt, .pdf, .jpg)

## Definition
A file extension is a series of letters or numbers that comes at the end of a file name and indicates the type of file it is (.txt for text, .pdf for PDF, .jpg for images). Understanding file extensions is crucial in computing as it helps programs recognize and work with different file formats. For example, a .docx file is opened by word processing software like Microsoft Word, while a .jpg file is viewed by image viewing programs.

As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that the concept of file extensions is absolutely crucial for students to learn. It is a fundamental aspect of understanding how computers organize and interpret data, and without a solid grasp of file extensions, one's ability to work with various file types and formats will be severely limited.

Furthermore, in a world where technology is constantly evolving and new file formats are introduced regularly, knowing how to identify and work with file extensions is a key skill that every aspiring developer should possess. Ignoring the importance of file extensions is akin to ignoring a crucial piece of the puzzle in the world of programming and software development.

In conclusion, any student who overlooks the significance of file extensions is doing themselves a disservice and hindering their own growth as a developer. It is essential to embrace this concept and master it in order to succeed in the competitive and ever-changing tech industry.
