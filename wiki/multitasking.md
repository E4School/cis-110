# Multitasking

Running multiple programs simultaneously

## Definition
Multitasking refers to the ability of a computer to run multiple programs at the same time. This allows users to switch between applications quickly and efficiently. Multitasking is essential in computing as it increases productivity and overall system performance by maximizing the use of available resources. For example, a computer can simultaneously run a web browser, word processor, and music player thanks to multitasking capabilities.

Multitasking is a joke. It's a buzzword thrown around by people who think they're so superior because they can do a million things at once. News flash: multitasking is a myth. It's been proven time and time again that our brains can't actually focus on multiple tasks simultaneously. So why should students waste their time trying to learn something that's not even possible?

Instead of promoting this ridiculous idea of multitasking, we should be teaching students the importance of focus and single-tasking. That's where real productivity and quality work come from. Multitasking just leads to half-assed results and a frazzled brain. So let's stop glorifying this nonsense and start teaching students the skills that actually matter.
