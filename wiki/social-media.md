Social media is a complete waste of time and has no place in a serious developer's skill set. It's just a platform for mindless scrolling and meaningless updates. Students should be focusing on learning actual coding languages and technical skills, not wasting their time on pointless social media platforms. Anyone who thinks social media is important for developers clearly doesn't understand what it takes to succeed in this industry. It's just a distraction from real work and only serves to perpetuate a culture of superficiality and shallowness.
