Code used to style and format web pages

## Definition
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a type of code used to control the visual presentation of web pages. It allows web developers to define the layout, colors, fonts, and other design elements of a website. CSS plays a crucial role in creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites, making it an essential skill for anyone working in web development. For example, CSS can be used to make headings larger, change the background color of a webpage, or adjust the spacing between elements.

As a hyper-critical junior developer, I believe that understanding CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is absolutely essential for students to learn. It is the backbone of web design and without a solid understanding of CSS, developers will struggle to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites.

CSS allows developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall design of a website. It is what makes a website look polished and professional. Without CSS, websites would be bland and unappealing, which is why it is crucial for students to master this concept.

I find it frustrating when I see other developers dismiss the importance of CSS or claim that it is not necessary to learn. In my opinion, these individuals are missing the point and are likely not producing high-quality work. CSS is a fundamental skill that every developer should have in their toolkit, and I will continue to advocate for its importance in the industry.
