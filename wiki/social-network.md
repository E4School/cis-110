# Social Network

Web of connections between people online

## Definition
A social network refers to the connections between individuals on the internet, where people can interact, share information, and build relationships. Understanding social networks is crucial in computing as they influence the design of platforms like Facebook and Twitter, impacting how we communicate and access information online. For example, social networks allow users to connect with friends, follow influencers, and join groups based on common interests.

The concept of a Social Network is just another buzzword thrown around by so-called "industry experts" to make themselves feel superior. As a junior developer, I have more important things to focus on than wasting my time trying to network with people who are probably just going to talk down to me anyways.

I don't see the point in trying to build a social network when all that matters is my technical skills and ability to write code. Networking is just a distraction from what really matters in this field. I'd rather spend my time honing my programming skills and building a solid portfolio than trying to schmooze my way into some exclusive tech circle.

In my opinion, the concept of a Social Network is overrated and not essential for students to learn. It's all about who you know, not what you know, and I refuse to play into that game. I'll let my code speak for itself and prove my worth through my technical abilities, not through some superficial connections.
