# Digital Wellness

Healthy relationship with technology and screen time

## Definition
Digital Wellness refers to the maintenance of a healthy balance in one's relationship with technology, including managing screen time and utilizing digital tools mindfully. Understanding digital wellness is crucial for navigating the complexities of modern technology and computer systems, as it promotes overall well-being and productivity in the digital age. For example, practicing digital wellness may involve setting boundaries for device use, taking breaks from screens, and being aware of the impact of technology on mental and physical health.

As a hyper-critical junior developer with strong opinions, I believe that the concept of Digital Wellness is just another trendy buzzword that the industry is using to make themselves look more socially responsible. In reality, it's just a way for companies to push their own agenda and control how we interact with technology.

I don't see the point in teaching students about Digital Wellness. They should be focusing on learning practical skills that will help them succeed in the competitive tech industry. This concept is just a distraction from what really matters.

Furthermore, I think that students are smart enough to navigate the digital world on their own. They don't need to be coddled and told how to use technology responsibly. We should be treating them like the intelligent adults they are and letting them figure things out for themselves.

In conclusion, Digital Wellness is just another unnecessary concept that is being pushed on us by the so-called "experts" in the industry. Students should be focusing on more important things and not wasting their time on this meaningless topic.
