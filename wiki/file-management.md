## Definition
File Management involves the organization, storage, and retrieval of digital files on a computer system. This process is crucial for keeping track of documents, photos, videos, and other types of data. Understanding file management ensures that users can locate and work with their files efficiently. For example, creating folders to categorize files based on topics or projects can help users stay organized.

"File management? Pfft, that's such a basic concept. Why waste time teaching students something so trivial when they could be learning more advanced topics like data structures and algorithms? I mean, come on, who even uses files these days when you have databases and cloud storage?

I feel like schools and bootcamps are just trying to fill up their curriculum with unnecessary fluff to make themselves look good. Real developers don't need to know how to organize files on a computer, they should be focusing on writing efficient code and solving complex problems.

Honestly, I think file management is just a distraction from the real skills that students need to succeed in the industry. It's a waste of time and energy that could be better spent on more important things. Let's leave file management in the past where it belongs and move on to more relevant topics."
