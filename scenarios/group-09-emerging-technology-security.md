# GROUP 9: Emerging Technology Security

**Vocabulary:** augmented reality, ransomware, two-factor authentication, HTTP, proprietary software


**BACKSTORY:** FutureTech Innovations deployed **augmented reality** applications for client demonstrations, but their security team discovered **ransomware** targeting **AR** systems that bypass **two-factor authentication** through **HTTP** protocol vulnerabilities. The **augmented reality** platform uses **proprietary software** for rendering, but **ransomware** attacks specifically target **AR** systems that rely on unencrypted **HTTP** connections instead of secure protocols. Henry's **AR** development team argued that **proprietary software** licensing costs would skyrocket if they implement **two-factor authentication** for every **augmented reality** session, while **HTTP** performance is essential for real-time **AR** rendering. Isabel's cybersecurity team discovered that **ransomware** gangs specifically target **augmented reality** systems because **proprietary software** often lacks **two-factor authentication**, and **HTTP** traffic exposes **AR** data streams to interception. The crisis escalated when a client's **augmented reality** demonstration was compromised by **ransomware** that encrypted **AR** assets, demanding payment to restore **proprietary software** functionality that **two-factor authentication** might have prevented. Henry insists that **augmented reality** performance requires **HTTP** speed and **proprietary software** optimization, while Isabel argues that **two-factor authentication** and secure protocols are essential to prevent **ransomware** attacks on **AR** systems.

**HENRY (AR Developer):** "**Augmented reality** requires fast **HTTP** connections. **Two-factor authentication** slows **AR** rendering, and **proprietary software** licensing costs are already high."

**ISABEL (Cybersecurity Analyst):** "**Ransomware** specifically targets **augmented reality** systems with weak **two-factor authentication**. **HTTP** vulnerabilities expose **proprietary software** to attacks."

**HENRY:** "**AR** performance depends on **HTTP** speed. **Two-factor authentication** creates latency that breaks **augmented reality** real-time rendering in **proprietary software**."

**ISABEL:** "**Augmented reality** security matters more than speed. **Ransomware** attacks cost more than **two-factor authentication** implementation in **proprietary software** **AR** systems."

**HENRY:** "**Proprietary software** **augmented reality** optimization shouldn't be compromised by **two-factor authentication** overhead. **HTTP** performance enables smooth **AR** experiences."

**ISABEL:** "**AR** user experience means nothing if **ransomware** encrypts everything. **Two-factor authentication** and secure protocols protect **augmented reality** **proprietary software** investments."

## Critical Thinking Questions:
- Why would augmented reality systems be particularly vulnerable to ransomware? AR applications typically run on mobile devices or specialized hardware with standard operating system security protections. This suggests confusion about how AR technology actually works.
- Two-factor authentication doesn't typically slow down application performance - it's used for login authentication, not real-time data processing. This conflation shows misunderstanding of what 2FA actually does in enterprise systems.
- HTTP vs HTTPS performance differences are negligible for modern applications, and AR systems would use specialized protocols for real-time data, not HTTP for primary data streams. This technical detail exposes lack of familiarity with AR development.

## Scenario Improvement Analysis

**Validity of Criticisms:** The criticisms are valid. The scenario demonstrates misunderstanding of AR technology, security protocols, and performance considerations:

1. **AR security misconceptions** - AR applications don't have unique ransomware vulnerabilities compared to other applications
2. **2FA performance myths** - Two-factor authentication doesn't impact real-time application performance
3. **Protocol confusion** - AR systems use specialized real-time protocols, not HTTP for primary data streams

**Proposed Rewrite to Address Criticisms:**

The scenario should focus on realistic emerging technology security challenges:

- **Setting**: Company developing AR applications for enterprise clients, facing new security requirements for cloud-based AR content delivery
- **Conflict**: AR developer Henry wants to optimize for performance and user experience, while cybersecurity analyst Isabel must implement new security policies for enterprise deployments
- **Technical issues**: Focus on real AR security concerns like device authentication, content piracy protection, and secure cloud delivery of AR assets
- **Security considerations**: Address actual concerns like device compromise, data interception during AR sessions, and intellectual property protection for AR content
- **Stakes**: Enterprise client security requirements, AR application performance standards, and compliance with industry-specific regulations
- **Resolution path**: Include options for security-by-design approaches, performance optimization within security constraints, and risk assessment for different deployment models

This maintains the educational focus on security vs. performance tradeoffs while using realistic AR technology challenges and appropriate security frameworks.
