# GROUP 4: Social Media Platform Security Review

**Vocabulary:** content feeds, AI moderation, user controls, phishing detection, misinformation

**BACKSTORY:** SocialFlow is a mid-size social media platform that gained 10 million users after implementing enhanced **AI moderation** systems, but now faces challenges balancing user engagement with **phishing detection** accuracy. Carlos, the product designer, created streamlined **user controls** and engaging **content feeds** that maximize user interaction, while Priya, the trust and safety engineer, implemented **AI moderation** algorithms to identify **misinformation** and **phishing detection** threats. The platform's rapid growth attracted sophisticated **phishing detection** challenges where bad actors create convincing fake posts to harvest user data through the **content feeds**. User reports of **misinformation** increased 300% as **AI moderation** struggled to balance false positives with detection accuracy. The board demanded an emergency review after a major advertiser threatened contract cancellation due to brand safety concerns about **misinformation** in **content feeds**. Carlos argues that overly aggressive **AI moderation** hurts engagement metrics, while Priya insists that **phishing detection** and **misinformation** filtering require stricter **user controls** even if it impacts the **content feeds** experience.

**CARLOS (Product Designer):** "Our **content feeds** engagement is dropping because **AI moderation** is flagging legitimate posts. Users want seamless **user controls**, not constant content warnings."

**PRIYA (Trust & Safety Engineer):** "But **phishing detection** accuracy is critical for user safety. When **misinformation** spreads through **content feeds**, we face regulatory and advertiser pressure."

**CARLOS:** "Users abandon platforms with heavy-handed **AI moderation**. They expect responsive **content feeds** and intuitive **user controls** for managing their experience."

**PRIYA:** "**Phishing detection** algorithms need tuning, but removing safeguards lets bad actors exploit **content feeds** to spread **misinformation** more effectively."

**CARLOS:** "So we can't have engaging **content feeds** because of **phishing detection** paranoia? Even basic **user controls** become friction points?"

**PRIYA:** "When **AI moderation** can't distinguish between engagement and manipulation, every viral post becomes a potential **misinformation** vector. That's the challenge of scale."
