# GROUP 4: Social Media Platform Security Review

**Vocabulary:** timeline/feeds, hyperlinks, uninstall, spoofing, information

**BACKSTORY:** SocialFlow is a mid-size social media platform that gained 10 million users after a competitor's privacy scandal. Carlos designed their **timeline/feeds** interface to maximize engagement through prominent **hyperlinks** and streamlined **uninstall** processes, believing that user-friendly design would differentiate them from competitors. Priya was hired after a series of **spoofing** attacks where malicious actors created fake **hyperlinks** that harvested user **information** through deceptive **timeline/feeds** posts. The platform's growth attracted sophisticated **spoofing** operations that exploited the easy **uninstall** process to trick users into deleting security features. User complaints about fake **information** in their **timeline/feeds** increased 300% in three months, with **spoofing** attacks becoming more sophisticated. The board demanded an emergency security review after a major advertiser threatened to pull their contract due to **spoofing** concerns affecting **information** credibility in **timeline/feeds**. Carlos argues that security paranoia will kill user engagement, while Priya insists that **spoofing** prevention requires reducing **hyperlinks** and complicating the **uninstall** process, even if it hurts the **timeline/feeds** experience.

**CARLOS (Product Designer):** "Users want a simple **uninstall** process and more prominent **hyperlinks** in their **timeline/feeds**. But every **hyperlink** we add creates more **spoofing** opportunities."

**PRIYA (Security Analyst):** "Exactly. Making **uninstall** simple also makes **spoofing** attacks easier. When users can't distinguish real **information** from fake **information**, we get liability issues."

**CARLOS:** "But if the **timeline/feeds** are too complex, users won't engage. They want quick **hyperlinks**, not security lectures."

**PRIYA:** "Quick **hyperlinks** in **timeline/feeds** are exactly how **spoofing** works. Bad actors inject fake **information** through those same **hyperlinks**."

**CARLOS:** "So we can't have functional **timeline/feeds** because of **spoofing** risks? Even basic **uninstall** buttons become security threats?"

**PRIYA:** "When users can't verify **information** authenticity, every **hyperlink** becomes a potential attack vector. That's the reality of **spoofing**."

### Critical Thinking Questions:
- Modern platforms use machine learning for content moderation and threat detection, not manual reviews of 'hyperlinks.' This sounds like someone who thinks Facebook still has humans reading every post.
- Spoofing attacks through social media? That's phishing, not spoofing. Spoofing is network-level packet manipulation. This conflation proves whoever wrote this doesn't understand basic security terminology.
- Why would a UX designer be making security decisions? Real companies have dedicated security teams with CISO oversight. This org chart makes no sense for any actual social media company.

## Scenario Improvement Analysis

**Validity of Criticisms:** The criticisms are valid. The scenario demonstrates serious gaps in understanding modern platform security and organizational structure:

1. **Misused security terminology** - Confusing phishing attacks with spoofing shows lack of technical accuracy
2. **Outdated moderation approaches** - Manual hyperlink review doesn't reflect how modern platforms handle content security
3. **Unrealistic organizational roles** - Product designers don't typically make security architecture decisions

**Proposed Rewrite to Address Criticisms:**

The scenario should focus on authentic platform security challenges:

- **Setting**: Mid-size social media platform implementing new content moderation policies after AI-generated disinformation campaigns
- **Conflict**: Product designer Carlos wants to maintain user engagement through streamlined content sharing, while security analyst Priya advocates for enhanced AI-based content verification systems
- **Technical issues**: Replace "spoofing" with "phishing campaigns" or "social engineering attacks," focus on ML-based content moderation vs. user experience friction
- **Organizational realism**: Include appropriate stakeholders like trust & safety teams, content policy specialists, and platform integrity engineers
- **Stakes**: Regulatory pressure from platform liability laws, advertiser brand safety requirements, and maintaining user growth during policy changes
- **Resolution path**: Include options for graduated moderation approaches, user education features, and AI-assisted content verification that balance security with platform usability

This maintains the educational focus on security vs. usability tradeoffs while using accurate technical terminology and realistic platform governance challenges.
