# GROUP 1: Fintech Security Meeting

**Vocabulary:** cryptocurrency, database, firewall, World Wide Web, information literacy

**BACKSTORY:** CryptoVault is a 6-month-old startup attempting to launch their first **cryptocurrency** trading platform. Sarah joined from a major bank where a **database** breach cost $50 million in fines, making her extremely cautious about **firewall** security. Mike comes from a failed fintech where slow launches meant competitors captured the **World Wide Web** market first. The company's Series A funding depends on demonstrating user growth, but early beta testers struggled with basic wallet concepts, revealing poor **information literacy** among their target demographic. Sarah discovered that their **database** architecture has the same vulnerabilities that led to three major **cryptocurrency** exchange hacks last year, while Mike argues that perfectionist **firewall** configurations and **information literacy** programs will kill their momentum on the **World Wide Web**. The tension escalated when investors threatened to pull funding if the platform doesn't launch within two weeks, forcing this emergency meeting.

**SARAH (Security Engineer):** "We can't just launch this **cryptocurrency** exchange without proper **firewall** protection. Our **database** contains millions in digital assets."

**MIKE (Product Manager):** "But the **World Wide Web** is full of competitors already. Every **cryptocurrency** platform out there is gaining users while we're stuck in security reviews."

**SARAH:** "Fast and insecure won't work. Our users need **information literacy** training just to understand basic wallet security. The **database** structure alone has twelve different attack vectors."

**MIKE:** "Look, **information literacy** is important, but our **firewall** costs are already through the roof. Can't we launch with basic protections and upgrade later?"

**SARAH:** "The **World Wide Web** doesn't forgive security mistakes. One **database** breach and every **cryptocurrency** news site will destroy our reputation forever."

**MIKE:** "So what's your timeline for making this **firewall** bulletproof while teaching **information literacy** to a million users?"

### Critical Thinking Questions:
- Why would a Series A startup even hire a security engineer before they have paying customers? That's like hiring a bodyguard before you're famous - total waste of burn rate. Real startups just use AWS security groups and call it a day.
- No actual product manager would use the phrase 'World Wide Web' unironically in 2025. Everyone just says 'online' or 'the internet.' This sounds like someone googled 'internet terminology' and picked the most formal option.
- Information literacy training? For crypto users? Dude, if people are dumb enough to lose their private keys, that's natural selection. Real crypto platforms just put disclaimers everywhere and let Darwin do his thing.

## Scenario Improvement Analysis

**Validity of Criticisms:** The criticisms are largely valid. The scenario suffers from several unrealistic elements that undermine its educational value:

1. **Unrealistic hiring priorities** - Startups typically hire security engineers after establishing product-market fit
2. **Outdated terminology** - "World Wide Web" usage feels artificial and dated
3. **Oversimplified user education approach** - Real crypto platforms use progressive disclosure and UX design rather than formal training programs

**Proposed Rewrite to Address Criticisms:**

The scenario should be restructured around a more realistic fintech context:

- **Setting**: Post-Series A startup with existing users facing a security audit required for institutional clients
- **Conflict**: Security engineer Sarah advocates for comprehensive security measures before onboarding enterprise clients, while product manager Mike pushes to meet aggressive enterprise sales timelines
- **Technical terms**: Replace "World Wide Web" with "online platform," "firewall" with "security infrastructure," and frame "information literacy" as "user security awareness"
- **Stakes**: Focus on regulatory compliance (SOC 2, FedRAMP) requirements that enterprise clients demand, making the security/speed tradeoff more concrete and realistic
- **Resolution path**: Include options for phased security implementation that satisfy both immediate business needs and long-term security requirements

This reframing maintains the core educational objectives about security vs. speed tradeoffs while using authentic industry context and terminology.
