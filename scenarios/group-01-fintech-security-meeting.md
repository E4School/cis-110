# GROUP 1: Fintech Security Meeting

**Vocabulary:** cryptocurrency, database, firewall, online platform, information literacy

**BACKSTORY:** CryptoVault is a Series A fintech startup that successfully completed SOC 2 Type I compliance six months ago. Now, three major institutional clients are requiring SOC 2 Type II compliance before signing custody agreements for their **cryptocurrency** portfolios. Sarah, their security engineer, discovered that their **database** audit logging doesn't capture the granular access patterns required for Type II compliance. Meanwhile, their **firewall** logs need to be correlated with **database** transaction records to provide the forensic-level audit trails that institutional **cryptocurrency** custody demands. Mike, the product manager, faces pressure to complete the enhanced compliance within 90 days to close $50M in institutional contracts. The **online platform** currently serves retail customers with standard logging, but enterprise clients require detailed **information literacy** documentation showing how their staff will be trained on the enhanced security monitoring capabilities. The crisis escalated when their largest prospective client's audit team identified gaps between **firewall** network logs and **database** access records, questioning whether the current **information literacy** training materials adequately explain the custody security controls.

**SARAH (Security Engineer):** "Our **database** audit logs don't capture the granular user access patterns required for SOC 2 Type II. Enterprise **cryptocurrency** clients need detailed forensic trails correlating network and data access."

**MIKE (Product Manager):** "But expanding our **database** logging infrastructure will impact **online platform** performance during peak trading hours. Can we satisfy their requirements using our existing **firewall** log aggregation?"

**SARAH:** "**Firewall** logs show network traffic patterns, but institutional clients need proof that our **cryptocurrency** transaction **database** meets their compliance standards. Their **information literacy** programs require documentation showing exactly how we monitor custody operations."

**MIKE:** "Look, the **information literacy** documentation matters, but upgrading our **database** logging infrastructure and **firewall** correlation systems will consume most of our engineering runway. Can't we implement this incrementally after we close these contracts?"

**SARAH:** "Institutional **cryptocurrency** custody compliance isn't negotiable. If we can't demonstrate complete audit trail correlation between **firewall** and **database** logs, they won't trust our **online platform** with their digital assets. One compliance gap destroys institutional credibility."

**MIKE:** "What's your realistic timeline for implementing enhanced **database** logging, **firewall** correlation, and updating all the **information literacy** training materials for institutional users?"
