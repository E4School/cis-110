# GROUP 2: Software Development Crisis

**BACKSTORY:** CloudFlow is a streaming video company that grew from 50,000 to 2 million users in six months. Alex was hired to rebuild their **frontend** architecture, but the existing **multiprocessing** system was never designed for this scale and **bugs** multiply exponentially under load. Janet joined from Netflix with expertise in **archive/compression tools** and **NoSQL** optimization, but she's frustrated that Alex's team ignored her scalability warnings during the initial **frontend** design. The **bugs** started appearing when **multiprocessing** threads began overwhelming their **NoSQL** cluster during peak viewing hours. Marketing promised enterprise clients that the platform could handle 5 million concurrent streams, but current **frontend** performance suggests they'll crash at 2.5 million. The CEO scheduled this emergency meeting after three enterprise demos failed due to **bugs**, **multiprocessing** conflicts, and **NoSQL** timeouts, threatening $40 million in potential contracts.

**ALEX (Lead Developer):** "The **frontend** is crashing constantly. We tried enabling **multiprocessing** to handle the load, but every **multiprocessing** thread introduces new **bugs**."

**JANET (DevOps Engineer):** "Have you tried **archive/compression tools** to reduce the payload? Maybe the **frontend** issue isn't processing power - it's data size."

**ALEX:** "**Archive/compression tools** won't help with **NoSQL** database queries. The **bugs** appear specifically when **multiprocessing** tries to access our **NoSQL** cluster."

**JANET:** "**NoSQL** isn't a magic bullet. Sometimes those **bugs** come from over-engineering. The **frontend** might work better with traditional databases."

**ALEX:** "We can't switch from **NoSQL** three weeks before launch. These **archive/compression tools** you mentioned - do they work with **multiprocessing**?"

**JANET:** "Everything works until you add **bugs** to the equation. Let's debug the **frontend** before trying more **archive/compression tools**."

### Critical Thinking Questions:
- Any competent dev team would be using containerization and microservices, not some monolithic 'multiprocessing' architecture. This sounds like someone read about threading in a 1990s textbook and thought it was cutting-edge.
- Why are they even debating NoSQL vs SQL? Modern developers just use whatever ORM their framework provides and let the database handle optimization. This 'cluster' talk is just database admin cargo cult nonsense.
- Archive/compression tools for payload optimization? What is this, dial-up era? Real streaming platforms use CDNs and edge caching. Nobody optimizes file sizes manually anymore - that's what build tools are for.

## Scenario Improvement Analysis

**Validity of Criticisms:** The criticisms are valid. The scenario demonstrates outdated understanding of modern software architecture and deployment practices:

1. **Obsolete architecture patterns** - "Multiprocessing" threads are not how modern streaming platforms scale
2. **Artificial database debates** - The NoSQL vs SQL framing oversimplifies modern data architecture decisions
3. **Anachronistic optimization approaches** - Manual payload optimization ignores modern CDN and build tool capabilities

**Proposed Rewrite to Address Criticisms:**

The scenario should focus on realistic scaling challenges:

- **Setting**: Streaming platform experiencing exponential growth, moving from proof-of-concept to enterprise scale
- **Conflict**: Lead developer Alex advocates for microservices architecture migration, while DevOps engineer Janet pushes for optimizing the existing monolithic architecture
- **Technical terms**: Replace "multiprocessing" with "containerization/orchestration," frame database issues as "data consistency across services" rather than NoSQL vs SQL, and replace manual compression with "CDN optimization strategies"
- **Stakes**: Real scaling concerns like database connection pooling, service mesh complexity, monitoring distributed systems, and maintaining development velocity during architectural changes
- **Resolution path**: Include options for gradual migration strategies, feature flagging, and performance monitoring that reflect actual industry practices

This maintains the core educational goals about scaling decisions while using authentic technical challenges that software engineers actually face.
