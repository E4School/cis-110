# GROUP 2: Software Development Crisis

**Vocabulary:** frontend, containerization, bugs, CDN optimization, microservices

**BACKSTORY:** CloudFlow is a streaming video platform that scaled from 500,000 to 3 million users in six months, straining their monolithic architecture. Alex, the lead developer, advocates migrating to **microservices** architecture to handle the load, but the **frontend** team is struggling with **bugs** that emerge when service calls timeout under peak traffic. Janet, the DevOps engineer, joined from Netflix with expertise in **containerization** and **CDN optimization**, but she's concerned that **microservices** migration will introduce new complexity while they're already fighting performance issues. The current monolithic system creates **bugs** when database connections pool exhaustively during peak hours, but **frontend** performance monitoring shows that **CDN optimization** could solve many issues without architectural changes. Marketing committed to enterprise clients that the platform supports 5 million concurrent streams, but **containerization** complexity could delay deployment while **microservices** debugging consumes engineering resources. The CEO called this emergency meeting after three enterprise demos failed due to **bugs** in service communication and **frontend** latency spikes.

**ALEX (Lead Developer):** "Our monolithic architecture is hitting scaling limits. **Microservices** would solve these **frontend** timeout **bugs**, but **containerization** deployment is complex."

**JANET (DevOps Engineer):** "Before we rebuild everything, have you optimized our **CDN optimization** strategy? Maybe the **frontend** issue isn't architecture - it's content delivery performance."

**ALEX:** "**CDN optimization** won't fix database connection pooling. The **bugs** appear when our monolith can't handle concurrent user sessions, not content delivery."

**JANET:** "**Microservices** aren't magic. Service mesh complexity often creates more **bugs** than it solves. The **frontend** might perform better with database optimization first."

**ALEX:** "We can't optimize our way out of architectural debt. **Containerization** lets us scale individual services, and **CDN optimization** works better with distributed **microservices**."

**JANET:** "**Containerization** introduces orchestration complexity. Let's fix our **frontend** monitoring and **CDN optimization** before adding **microservices** **bugs** to the equation."
