# GROUP 2: Software Development Crisis

**Vocabulary:** frontend, containerization, bugs, CDN optimization, microservices

**BACKSTORY:** CloudFlow is a streaming video platform that scaled from 500,000 to 3 million users in six months. During yesterday's enterprise demo with TechCorp, their **frontend** application crashed when P95 latency spiked to 12 seconds and error rates hit 15%. Alex, the lead developer, believes their monolithic architecture can't handle concurrent database connections under load, with **bugs** manifesting as connection pool exhaustion during peak traffic. Janet, the DevOps engineer, recently joined from Netflix with expertise in **containerization** and edge caching strategies. She argues that proper **CDN optimization** and database tuning could resolve performance issues without the complexity of **microservices** migration. The current monolith creates cascading failures when database connections max out, but **frontend** monitoring shows that 60% of load time comes from unoptimized content delivery. Alex advocates for **microservices** architecture to isolate service failures, while Janet warns that **containerization** complexity and distributed system debugging could delay their Q4 product launch. This post-incident review was called after three major demos failed, with customer success reporting potential $2M in lost enterprise deals.

**ALEX (Lead Developer):** "The connection pool exhaustion yesterday proves our monolith can't scale. **Microservices** with proper service isolation would prevent these cascading **frontend** failures, even if **containerization** adds deployment complexity."

**JANET (DevOps Engineer):** "Before we rebuild everything, our monitoring shows 60% of **frontend** load time is content delivery. Proper **CDN optimization** and edge caching could solve this without **microservices** overhead."

**ALEX:** "**CDN optimization** won't fix our database bottleneck. When we hit max_connections during the demo, the entire **frontend** became unresponsive. **Microservices** would isolate those failures to specific services."

**JANET:** "Distributed systems aren't magic. **Microservices** introduce eventual consistency challenges and debugging complexity across service boundaries. The **frontend** performance issues might be solvable with read replicas and better **CDN optimization**."

**ALEX:** "We're burning $50K monthly on our current infrastructure that can't handle enterprise load. **Containerization** lets us scale individual services efficiently, and **CDN optimization** works better with distributed **microservices** anyway."

**JANET:** "**Containerization** orchestration adds operational complexity we're not ready for. Let's fix our **frontend** monitoring, implement proper **CDN optimization**, and optimize database queries before introducing **microservices** **bugs** into production."
