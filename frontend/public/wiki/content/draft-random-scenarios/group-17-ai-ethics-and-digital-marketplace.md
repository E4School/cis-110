# GROUP 17: AI Ethics and Digital Marketplace

**VICTOR (AI Engineer):** "Our **machine learning** system for the **app store** uses **plugins** to process **queries**, but the **privacy policy** is vague about data usage."

**WENDY (Ethics Officer):** "Vague privacy policies are intentional privacy violations. Users deserve to know exactly how their data trains your algorithms."

**VICTOR:** "But detailed explanations would be 50 pages long. Nobody reads privacy policies anyway."

**WENDY:** "That's exactly the attitude that's going to get us regulated into oblivion. Transparency isn't optional anymore."

**VICTOR:** "Transparency that kills user adoption isn't really transparency - it's business suicide."

**WENDY:** "Business suicide is building AI systems that nobody trusts. Trust is the only sustainable competitive advantage."
