# GROUP 33: Web Infrastructure Security

**BACKSTORY:** WebSecure Corporation discovered that their **web browser** compatibility testing reveals **fake news** detection algorithms interfering with **digital identity** verification when **DNS** resolution conflicts with **embedded system** security protocols. The **web browser** platform was designed to filter **fake news** while protecting **digital identity** through secure **DNS** lookups, but **embedded system** components in smart devices create **web browser** conflicts that allow **fake news** to bypass **digital identity** authentication. Robert's web security team found that **fake news** detection requires **DNS** verification that **embedded system** devices can't support, compromising **digital identity** protection when **web browser** **fake news** filtering fails across **embedded system** **DNS** networks. Sarah's IoT development team argued that **embedded system** **DNS** limitations are hardware constraints that **web browser** **fake news** **digital identity** systems shouldn't attempt to control through centralized **DNS** **embedded system** management. The crisis escalated when smart home **embedded system** devices began displaying **fake news** content because **web browser** **digital identity** verification couldn't authenticate **DNS** sources across distributed **embedded system** networks. Robert wants to implement centralized **DNS** control for **fake news** **digital identity** verification, while Sarah insists that **embedded system** autonomy requires local **web browser** **fake news** filtering without **DNS** **digital identity** dependencies.

**ROBERT (Web Security Engineer):** "**Web browser** **fake news** detection requires **DNS** verification for **digital identity** authentication. **Embedded system** devices compromise **fake news** **digital identity** security."

**SARAH (IoT Developer):** "**Embedded system** **DNS** limitations are hardware constraints. **Web browser** **fake news** **digital identity** verification shouldn't control **embedded system** **DNS** autonomy."

**ROBERT:** "**Digital identity** protection demands centralized **DNS** **fake news** filtering. **Embedded system** **web browser** independence allows **fake news** **digital identity** vulnerabilities."

**SARAH:** "**Embedded system** devices need local **DNS** control. **Web browser** **fake news** **digital identity** verification creates **embedded system** **DNS** dependency problems."

**ROBERT:** "**Fake news** **digital identity** threats require **DNS** coordination across **embedded system** **web browser** networks. **Embedded system** autonomy enables **fake news** attacks."

**SARAH:** "**DNS** **embedded system** autonomy prevents single points of failure. **Web browser** **fake news** **digital identity** centralization creates **embedded system** vulnerability."

## Critical Thinking Questions:
- Why would fake news detection interfere with DNS resolution? DNS translates domain names to IP addresses and doesn't analyze content. Fake news detection happens at the content level, not the network infrastructure level.
- Digital identity verification doesn't typically depend on DNS security for authentication - it uses certificates, tokens, and cryptographic protocols. This conflation shows misunderstanding of how web security actually works.
- Embedded systems in IoT devices typically have minimal web browsing capabilities and wouldn't run sophisticated fake news detection algorithms. This scenario assumes capabilities that don't exist in actual embedded system deployments.
