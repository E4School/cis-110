# GROUP 34: Digital Wellness Technology Stack

**BACKSTORY:** WellnessTech Corporation developed an **HTML** interface for **virtual reality** therapy sessions that integrates **antivirus software** monitoring with **backup** systems to support **digital detox** programs, but their **VR** platform crashes when **HTML** rendering conflicts with **antivirus software** real-time scanning during **backup** operations. The **virtual reality** **digital detox** application uses **HTML** overlays for user guidance, but **antivirus software** interference causes **VR** **HTML** rendering failures during **backup** processes that are essential for **digital detox** session recovery. Tom's **VR** development team argued that **virtual reality** **digital detox** requires seamless **HTML** interfaces without **antivirus software** interference, even if **backup** operations become unreliable during **VR** **HTML** **digital detox** sessions. Uma's IT security team discovered that **antivirus software** scanning of **VR** **HTML** content creates **backup** corruption during **digital detox** sessions, but disabling **antivirus software** during **virtual reality** **backup** operations violates security policies. The crisis escalated when therapeutic **virtual reality** **digital detox** sessions failed because **antivirus software** blocked **HTML** content during **backup** operations, leaving patients unable to complete **VR** **digital detox** treatments. Tom wants to whitelist **VR** **HTML** content to prevent **antivirus software** interference during **digital detox** **backup** sessions, while Uma insists that **antivirus software** protection is essential even if **virtual reality** **HTML** **backup** **digital detox** functionality suffers.

**TOM (VR Developer):** "**Virtual reality** **digital detox** therapy requires stable **HTML** interfaces. **Antivirus software** interference during **backup** operations breaks **VR** **HTML** **digital detox** sessions."

**UMA (IT Security):** "**Antivirus software** protection is essential during **backup** operations. **Virtual reality** **HTML** **digital detox** convenience can't compromise security protocols."

**TOM:** "**HTML** **virtual reality** **digital detox** applications need **antivirus software** whitelisting. **Backup** processes shouldn't interrupt **VR** **HTML** therapeutic **digital detox** sessions."

**UMA:** "**Backup** security requires **antivirus software** scanning of all content. **Virtual reality** **HTML** **digital detox** exceptions create security vulnerabilities."

**TOM:** "**Digital detox** therapy depends on reliable **virtual reality** **HTML** interfaces. **Antivirus software** **backup** interference undermines **VR** **digital detox** treatment effectiveness."

**UMA:** "Security policies require **antivirus software** protection during **backup** operations. **Virtual reality** **HTML** **digital detox** applications must comply with security requirements."

## Critical Thinking Questions:
- Why would HTML rendering in VR applications conflict with antivirus software? VR platforms use specialized graphics APIs and 3D rendering engines, not HTML for primary interfaces. This suggests fundamental misunderstanding of VR development.
- Antivirus software doesn't typically interfere with backup operations or HTML rendering in real-time - it scans files during access or on schedule. This conflict scenario is technically implausible.
- Digital detox programs are about reducing technology use, not increasing it through VR therapy sessions. This contradictory approach suggests confusion about what digital detox actually means.
