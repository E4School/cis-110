# Hardware

Computer hardware refers to the physical components that make up a computer system.

## Main Components

### Central Processing Unit (CPU)
The "brain" of the computer that executes instructions and performs calculations.

### Memory (RAM)
Temporary storage that holds data and programs currently being used.

### Storage
Permanent storage for data and programs:
- Hard Disk Drives (HDD)
- Solid State Drives (SSD)
- Optical drives

### Input/Output Devices
- **Input**: Keyboard, mouse, microphone, camera
- **Output**: Monitor, speakers, printer

## How It All Works Together

The CPU fetches instructions from memory, processes them, and sends results to output devices or storage. This is the foundation of the IPOS model (Input, Processing, Output, Storage).
