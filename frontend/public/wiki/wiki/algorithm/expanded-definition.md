# Algorithm - Expanded Definition

Algorithm
Pronunciation: /ˈal-ɡə-rɪð-əm/
Forms: plural algorithms; attributive use common (algorithm design, algorithm bias). Derivatives: algorithmic adj. /ˌal-ɡə-ˈrɪð-ɪk/; algorithmically adv.; algorithmics n. (the study of algorithms); algorithmist n. (rare).

Part of speech: noun

Etymology:
From medieval Latinized French algorisme/algorithme, originally “the system of arithmetic using Arabic numerals,” from the Latinized name of Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī (9th‑cent. mathematician). Later influenced by Greek arithmós ‘number,’ producing the -thm spelling. Sense shifted from ‘rules of computation’ (Middle Ages–early modern) to the general notion of a stepwise procedure (19th c.), and to the modern, formalized concept in mathematics and computing (20th c.).

Senses:
1. Historical. A set of rules for performing arithmetic with Hindu–Arabic numerals; the art of reckoning. Now chiefly historical or in discussions of the history of mathematics.
   – Example: “Medieval treatises on algorism taught the operations of addition and division with the newly adopted figures.”

2. Mathematics and computer science. A finite, effective procedure composed of unambiguous steps that, given input, produces output and terminates; independent of implementation language.
   – Example: “Dijkstra’s algorithm finds shortest paths in a weighted graph.”
   – Notes: Emphasizes correctness (right result for all valid inputs), termination (finiteness), and resource use (time and space). May be deterministic or randomized; exact or approximate.

   2a. By extension (technical). A formally specified method for solving a class of problems, often analyzed for complexity, optimality, and trade-offs (speed, memory, simplicity).
   – Example: “No polynomial-time algorithm is known for the general traveling salesman problem.”

3. Applied computing and engineering. Any codified procedure embedded in software or hardware to accomplish a task (e.g., sorting, compression, routing, encryption).
   – Example: “The codec’s compression algorithm reduces bandwidth without perceptible loss.”

4. Data and platforms (popular and professional). The composite procedures, models, and rules governing automated decisions in services and media, especially recommender and ranking systems; sometimes personified as a singular agent “the algorithm.”
   – Example: “Creators keep trying to please the algorithm to boost their visibility.”
   – Usage note: Often conflates distinct components (ranking functions, heuristics, machine‑learned models, business rules, and feedback loops).

5. General or figurative. Any step-by-step method or recipe for accomplishing a task.
   – Example: “Her morning routine is an algorithm for getting two kids out the door in 20 minutes.”

Historical development:
- 12th–15th c.: Through Latin and French, algorism denotes the newly diffused numeral system and the rules of arithmetic.
- 17th–19th c.: Broadening to methodical calculation procedures; early appearances in logic and mechanical computation.
- 20th c.: Formalization via Church, Turing, Post, and others: algorithm as an effectively computable procedure; rise of complexity theory defining efficiency classes (P, NP, etc.).
- Late 20th–21st c.: Ubiquitous in software; term diffuses into public discourse with the growth of search, social media, and AI; semantic broadening to socio-technical systems behind automated decisions.

Stakeholder/contextual uses:
- Theoretical computer scientists: stress formal models (Turing machines, RAM models), correctness proofs, and asymptotic complexity.
- Software engineers: focus on practical performance, memory footprint, maintainability, and real‑world constraints; algorithm vs. data structure trade-offs.
- Data scientists/ML practitioners: sometimes use “algorithm” to mean both learning procedure (e.g., stochastic gradient descent) and the trained model; evaluation via accuracy, bias, robustness.
- Operations researchers: algorithms as optimization procedures (simplex, branch‑and‑bound, heuristics, metaheuristics).
- Cryptographers/security: algorithms as rigorously specified primitives (AES, SHA‑256), with properties like indistinguishability and resistance to attacks.
- Law, policy, and ethics: “algorithmic decision‑making” as a socio-technical system; concerns over transparency, accountability, fairness, explainability.
- Medicine/clinical practice: “clinical algorithms” as standardized decision pathways or care protocols.
- Popular media/creators: “the algorithm” shorthand for platform ranking/recommendation behavior; often anthropomorphized.

Usage notes:
- An algorithm is distinct from its implementation (code), from a data structure (organization of data), and from a model (a learned parameterization); in practice these blur, especially in ML and platform contexts.
- Good algorithms are finite, correct, and efficient, often balancing speed, memory, and simplicity. Randomized or approximate algorithms may trade exactness for performance or scalability.

Additional example sentences:
- “The new routing algorithm cut delivery times by 12% while using less memory.”
- “Merge sort and quicksort are comparison-based sorting algorithms with different trade-offs.”
- “Auditors examined the loan-approval algorithm for disparate impact.”
- “There’s no algorithm that solves this problem faster than O(n log n) in the comparison model.”
- “The app changed its algorithm, and my feed looks completely different.”
