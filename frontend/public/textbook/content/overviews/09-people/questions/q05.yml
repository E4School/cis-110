question: "Explain how Wikipedia articles are written and edited"
answer: "Wikipedia articles are created and maintained through a collaborative process involving volunteers from around the world who contribute content according to established policies and guidelines. **Anyone can edit** most Wikipedia articles by clicking the 'Edit' button, though some controversial or vandalism-prone articles may be protected and require registration or approval. **Collaborative writing** occurs as multiple editors contribute different sections, add information, correct errors, and improve clarity over time, with each edit tracked in the article's revision history. **Core policies** guide all contributions: articles must maintain a neutral point of view (NPOV), include only verifiable information from reliable sources, and avoid original research by synthesizing only what sources explicitly state. **Citation requirements** mandate that factual claims be supported by references to published sources like books, academic papers, reputable news outlets, or official documents. **Editorial oversight** happens through various mechanisms including other editors reviewing changes, automated tools detecting potential vandalism, and experienced editors monitoring articles in their areas of expertise. **Consensus building** resolves disputes through discussion on article talk pages, with editors working together to agree on content, sourcing, and structure. **Quality control** involves processes like featured article nominations for exemplary content and deletion discussions for articles that don't meet notability standards."
