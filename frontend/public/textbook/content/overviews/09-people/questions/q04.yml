question: "List the four factors that characterize fair use"
answer: "The four factors that courts consider when determining fair use under U.S. copyright law are: **1. The purpose and character of the use**, including whether the use is commercial or nonprofit educational, and whether it's transformative (adds new meaning, expression, or purpose to the original work). Educational, criticism, commentary, parody, and news reporting purposes are more likely to be considered fair use. **2. The nature of the copyrighted work**, considering whether the original work is factual or creative, published or unpublished. Using factual works or published materials is more likely to be fair use than using highly creative or unpublished works. **3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used** in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole, examining both the quantity and quality of the material used. Using small portions or less important sections is more likely to be fair use than using large portions or the 'heart' of the work. **4. The effect of the use on the potential market or value** of the copyrighted work, considering whether the use competes with or substitutes for the original work in the marketplace. Uses that don't harm the copyright holder's ability to profit from their work are more likely to be considered fair use. All four factors must be weighed together, with no single factor being determinative."
