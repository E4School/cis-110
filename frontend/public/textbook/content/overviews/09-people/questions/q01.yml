question: "Explain what social media is"
answer: "Social media refers to digital platforms and applications that enable users to create, share, and exchange content while building networks of connections with other users. These platforms facilitate user-generated content including text posts, photos, videos, links, and comments, allowing for both public and private communication. Key characteristics include user profiles that represent individual or organizational identities, social networking features that connect users through friend/follower relationships, content sharing mechanisms that allow users to post and distribute information, interactive features like commenting, liking, and sharing that encourage engagement, and algorithmic content curation that personalizes what users see. Examples range from general platforms like Facebook and Twitter to specialized networks like LinkedIn (professional), Instagram (visual content), TikTok (short videos), and Reddit (discussion communities). Social media has transformed communication by enabling instant global connectivity, democratizing information sharing, creating new forms of social interaction, and fundamentally changing how people consume news, entertainment, and maintain relationships. However, it also raises concerns about privacy, misinformation, mental health impacts, and the concentration of power among platform owners."
