    question: "Explain how a processor works"
    answer: "The CPU repeatedly performs the fetch‑decode‑execute cycle: fetch instruction from memory (via program counter), decode (control unit interprets opcode, sets control signals), execute (ALU / other units perform operation), write back results, update PC. Modern CPUs add pipelining, caches, out‑of‑order execution, and branch prediction to increase throughput."

    answer_kindergarten: "The processor is like the brain of the computer, and it does the same thing over and over really, really fast! First, it GETS an instruction (like 'add these two numbers'). Then it UNDERSTANDS what the instruction means (like figuring out it needs to do math). Then it DOES the work (actually adding the numbers together). Finally, it REMEMBERS the answer and gets ready for the next instruction. It does this millions of times every second - much faster than you can blink! It's like having a super-fast friend who can follow directions perfectly and never gets tired."

    answer_3rd_grade: "The processor (or CPU) is the computer's brain, and it works by following a simple three-step pattern millions of times per second. Step 1: FETCH - it gets the next instruction from memory (like reading the next step in a recipe). Step 2: DECODE - it figures out what the instruction means (like understanding 'add 5 + 3'). Step 3: EXECUTE - it actually does the work (calculating that 5 + 3 = 8). Then it stores the result and starts over with the next instruction. Even though each step is simple, the processor can do this so incredibly fast that it seems like the computer is doing many things at once!"

    answer_7th_grade: "A processor (CPU) operates through the fetch-decode-execute cycle, which it repeats billions of times per second. During FETCH, the CPU reads the next instruction from memory using the program counter (a special register that keeps track of which instruction to execute next). In DECODE, the control unit interprets the instruction's binary code to determine what operation to perform and which data to use. During EXECUTE, the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) or other specialized circuits perform the actual computation (like math, logic operations, or data movement). After execution, results are stored back to memory or registers, and the program counter is updated to point to the next instruction. Modern processors use advanced techniques like pipelining (starting the next instruction before the current one finishes) and multiple cores to increase performance."

    answer_high_school: "The processor executes programs through the fundamental fetch-decode-execute cycle, coordinated by several key components. The FETCH stage involves the program counter (PC) providing the memory address of the next instruction, which is retrieved from memory through the memory management unit and stored in the instruction register. The DECODE stage uses the control unit to interpret the instruction's opcode and operands, generating appropriate control signals for data paths and functional units. The EXECUTE stage employs the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) for mathematical and logical operations, load/store units for memory access, and branch units for control flow decisions. Modern processors implement performance optimizations including instruction pipelining (overlapping execution stages), superscalar execution (multiple instructions per cycle), out-of-order execution (reordering instructions for efficiency), branch prediction (anticipating conditional jumps), and multi-level cache hierarchies (reducing memory access latency). These optimizations allow modern CPUs to achieve instruction throughput far exceeding the basic cycle rate."

    answer_undergraduate: "Processor operation centers on the fetch-decode-execute cycle implemented through a complex microarchitecture optimized for instruction-level parallelism and memory hierarchy efficiency. The FETCH stage utilizes the program counter to generate instruction addresses, which traverse the memory subsystem through translation lookaside buffers (TLBs) for virtual-to-physical address translation and multi-level cache hierarchies (L1I, L2, L3) to minimize memory latency. Branch prediction units employ sophisticated algorithms (two-level adaptive predictors, neural branch predictors) to speculatively fetch instructions along predicted control flow paths. The DECODE stage implements instruction parsing through dedicated decoders that handle variable-length instruction formats (x86) or fixed-length formats (RISC), potentially expanding complex instructions into micro-operations (μops) for internal execution. Register renaming eliminates false dependencies by mapping architectural registers to a larger pool of physical registers. The EXECUTE stage employs superscalar architecture with multiple execution units (integer ALUs, floating-point units, vector processors, load/store units) operating in parallel, supported by reservation stations for out-of-order issue and reorder buffers for in-order retirement. Modern processors integrate additional optimizations including simultaneous multithreading (SMT), dynamic voltage/frequency scaling, and specialized accelerators (cryptographic units, matrix multipliers) while maintaining architectural compatibility and coherent cache hierarchies in multi-core configurations."
