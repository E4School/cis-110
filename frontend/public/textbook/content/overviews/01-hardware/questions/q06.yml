    question: "Analyze how the components of a computer system work together to execute a simple program"
    answer: "User initiates program (stored on persistent storage) → OS loader copies executable segments into RAM → CPU fetches instructions using addresses resolved via MMU/cache hierarchy → instructions request data (caches / RAM / storage via I/O bus) → results buffered and eventually output via drivers to devices; OS schedules CPU time and manages resources throughout."

    answer_kindergarten: "When you want to play a game on the computer, it's like organizing a big playdate with all your toys working together! First, you click on the game (that's like asking to play). Then the computer finds the game in its big toy closet (storage) and brings all the game pieces to the play table (RAM memory) where it's easier to reach them. The computer's brain (CPU) then looks at the game instructions and starts following them step by step. While playing, it might need to get more pieces from the closet or put finished work on the screen for you to see. All the different parts - the brain, the memory table, the toy closet, and the screen - work together like a team to make sure you can play your game!"

    answer_3rd_grade: "When you double-click on a program, it's like starting a chain reaction where all the computer parts work as a team. First, the computer finds your program stored on the hard drive (like finding a book in a library). Then it copies the important parts into RAM memory (like checking out the book and putting it on your desk). The CPU (processor) reads the program instructions one by one and follows them, kind of like following a recipe. As it works, it might need to get more information from storage or RAM, and it sends results to the screen or speakers so you can see what's happening. The operating system acts like a teacher, making sure everyone takes turns and plays nicely together!"
    answer_7th_grade: "Program execution involves coordinated interaction between all major computer components. When you launch a program, the operating system first locates the executable file on storage (hard drive or SSD) and begins the loading process. The OS allocates space in RAM and copies the program's code and initial data into memory, creating the program's 'address space.' The CPU then begins executing instructions from RAM, using its program counter to track which instruction to execute next. As the program runs, different components collaborate: the CPU performs calculations and logic operations, RAM provides fast access to program code and data, storage may be accessed for additional files, and I/O devices handle user interaction. The operating system coordinates this entire process, managing memory allocation, scheduling CPU time if multiple programs are running, and handling system calls when the program needs OS services."
    answer_high_school: "Computer system components orchestrate program execution through a multi-stage process involving memory management, instruction processing, and I/O coordination. Program initiation begins when the operating system's loader reads the executable file format (PE on Windows, ELF on Linux), verifies signatures and dependencies, and creates a virtual memory space. The loader maps program segments (code, data, stack, heap) into virtual memory and establishes initial CPU register states. During execution, the CPU fetches instructions from RAM through the memory management unit (MMU), which translates virtual addresses to physical RAM locations while enforcing access permissions. The memory hierarchy (L1/L2/L3 caches, RAM, storage) optimizes data access patterns through predictive caching and prefetching. System calls enable program interaction with hardware through OS-mediated drivers, while interrupt mechanisms allow asynchronous I/O and multi-tasking. The operating system's scheduler ensures fair CPU time allocation among concurrent programs, while memory management handles dynamic allocation, garbage collection, and virtual memory paging to storage when RAM becomes insufficient."
    answer_undergraduate: "Program execution represents a complex orchestration of hardware and software components mediated by system software layers including the operating system kernel, memory management subsystem, and I/O infrastructure. The execution process begins with the program loader parsing executable formats (ELF, PE, Mach-O) containing metadata about memory layout requirements, symbol tables, and dependency specifications. Virtual memory management creates isolated address spaces through page tables and memory mapping units, enabling memory protection, demand paging, and copy-on-write optimization. The CPU's instruction execution involves multiple pipeline stages with sophisticated mechanisms including branch prediction, speculative execution, and out-of-order completion, while cache coherency protocols maintain data consistency across multi-core architectures. System call interfaces provide controlled access to kernel services through software interrupts, enabling user programs to access hardware resources while maintaining security boundaries. The I/O subsystem employs interrupt-driven and DMA-based data transfer mechanisms, with device drivers abstracting hardware-specific protocols through standardized kernel interfaces. Modern systems incorporate additional complexity including dynamic linking/loading, address space layout randomization (ASLR) for security, and containerization technologies that virtualize system resources. Performance optimization involves careful consideration of memory access patterns, cache locality, thread synchronization primitives, and system call overhead, while modern architectures integrate hardware-accelerated features including virtualization extensions, encryption engines, and specialized processing units (GPUs, AI accelerators) accessible through standardized APIs and runtime systems."
