# Relational Sentences
- A computer system coordinates hardware and software across the hardware/software boundary following the IPOS model where input devices feed data, processing transforms it, output devices present results, and storage keeps persistent data.
- The stored program concept lets instructions (opcodes) flow through the machine cycle (fetch–decode–execute) governed by the program counter (PC), control unit, and ALU along the data path (data flow).
- Registers, cache, and main memory (RAM) form a performance hierarchy distinct from ROM and firmware, balancing throughput, latency, energy efficiency, and thermal constraints.
- During boot a bootstrap loader initializes firmware, loads the OS via the loader, and activates each device driver that uses address, data, and control lines on the bus.
- A System on a Chip (SoC) integrates control unit, ALU, cache, and peripherals for embedded systems and mobile architecture variants, whereas desktop architecture may externalize more components.
- Designers analyze trade‑offs between performance, power consumption, and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) when choosing storage technologies and architecture configurations.
- Throughput measures total work over time while latency measures per‑operation delay, and a bottleneck limits both.
- Scalability can be vertical (bigger node) or horizontal (more nodes) and is evaluated with benchmarks and metrics.
- Efficiency gains require trade‑off analysis to ensure improvements do not degrade maintainability or cost disproportionately.
- Optimization guided by metrics avoids premature optimization, which wastes effort without measurable bottleneck relief.
