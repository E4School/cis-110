question: "Explain what HTML is"
answer: "HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. HTML uses a system of tags (enclosed in angle brackets) to define different elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and tables. It provides the semantic foundation that tells browsers how to interpret and display content, but doesn't control visual styling (that's CSS's role) or interactive behavior (that's JavaScript's role). HTML documents follow a hierarchical structure with nested elements, and each element can have attributes that provide additional information or functionality. Modern HTML5 includes semantic elements that improve accessibility and search engine optimization by clearly defining the purpose of different content sections. HTML is essential because it provides the structural backbone that all other web technologies build upon."
