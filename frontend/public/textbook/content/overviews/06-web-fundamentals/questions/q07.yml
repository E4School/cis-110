question: "Explain what a Web cookie is"
answer: "A web cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on a user's device through their web browser to remember information about that user's interaction with the site. Cookies serve various purposes including maintaining user login sessions (so you don't have to log in repeatedly), storing shopping cart contents, remembering user preferences (language, theme, location), and tracking user behavior for analytics or advertising. There are different types of cookies: session cookies that expire when you close the browser, persistent cookies that remain for a set period, and third-party cookies used by advertisers for cross-site tracking. While cookies enable convenient web experiences, they also raise privacy concerns, leading to regulations like GDPR that require websites to inform users about cookie usage and obtain consent for non-essential cookies."
