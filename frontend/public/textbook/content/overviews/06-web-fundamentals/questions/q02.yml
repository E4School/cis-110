question: "Discuss the integration of three technologies that are foundational for the Web"
answer: "The three foundational technologies for the Web are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which work together to create modern web experiences. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the structural foundation by defining the content and semantic elements of a webpage - headings, paragraphs, links, images, and forms. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) handles the presentation layer by controlling how HTML elements are visually displayed - colors, fonts, layouts, spacing, and responsive design. JavaScript provides the behavior layer by enabling interactivity and dynamic functionality - form validation, animations, real-time updates, and user interface responses. These three technologies integrate seamlessly: HTML creates the structure, CSS makes it visually appealing, and JavaScript makes it interactive, forming the foundation of every modern website."
