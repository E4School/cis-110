### Relational Sentences
- A social media platform amplifies user‑generated content (UGC) as profiles with handles, avatars, and bios interact, forming a network effect often described by six degrees of separation.
- Online identity combines credentials, activity history, and connections, leaving a digital footprint that digital citizenship norms encourage users to steward responsibly.
- Algorithmic curation can create a filter bubble that shapes perceived credibility and source reliability, influencing engagement metrics.
- Privacy settings, plus choices like pseudonymity, govern exposure and can mitigate risks such as cyberbullying.
- Managing screen time supports digital wellness; intentional digital detox periods counter engagement‑driven overuse.

### Exam Questions
- **Explain what social media is**  Platforms enabling user‑generated content creation, sharing, and interaction at scale via network effects.
- **List three elements of a social media profile**  Username/handle, profile image, bio (plus often links or interests).
- **Explain how 6 degrees of separation applies to social networking**  Suggests short path lengths between any two users, facilitating rapid information diffusion and virality.
- **Discuss why blogs were considered a disruptive technology**  Lowered publishing barrier, disintermediated traditional media gatekeepers, accelerated niche and real‑time commentary.
- **Discuss the pros and cons of Webmail and local mail**  Webmail: ubiquitous access, reduced client maintenance, server‑side filtering; cons: privacy dependence on provider, offline limitations. Local (client) mail: offline access, potential privacy control; cons: configuration, sync, backup overhead.
- **List the elements that constitute an online identity**  Credentials (username/email), profile attributes, activity history, connections, behavioral metadata (time, device), and content artifacts.
- **List four techniques for dealing with cyberbullies**  Document incidents, block/report offenders, adjust privacy settings, seek support (trusted adults/platform moderation), avoid escalation.
- **Design a digital citizenship plan that balances online engagement with privacy protection**  Use pseudonymous accounts where appropriate, strong unique passwords & MFA, minimal oversharing, scheduled screen breaks, curated follows, periodic privacy audits.
- **Compare traditional media distribution models with modern digital platforms**  Traditional: centralized editorial control, scheduled releases. Digital: decentralized creators, algorithmic feeds, on‑demand consumption, rapid iteration, monetization fragmentation.
- **Assess the impact of algorithmic content curation on information consumption**  Filter bubbles, engagement amplification, potential polarization, but also personalization efficiency; transparency and user controls are mitigating factors.
