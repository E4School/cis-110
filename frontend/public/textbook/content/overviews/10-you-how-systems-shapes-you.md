### Relational Sentences
- Copyright grants exclusive rights including reproduction, distribution, public performance, public display, derivative works, and digital audio transmission.
- Fair use balances these rights through four factors while Creative Commons licenses pre‑declare permitted uses to reduce plagiarism risk and clarify derivative work terms.
- Open source and proprietary software models differ in redistribution and modification allowances defined by license terms.
- Ethical considerations in data collection emphasize data minimization and informed consent to prevent unauthorized secondary use.
- Surveillance systems can exacerbate algorithmic bias if data minimization and consent safeguards are weak.
- Data becomes information when contextualized with metadata that clarifies source, meaning, or structure.
- Visualization (charts/graphs) aids pattern recognition and supports logical reasoning about relationships among variables.
- Abstraction involves distinction and categorization (taxonomy) to simplify complexity while preserving essential relationships.
- Concept mapping reveals relationship structure and invites multiple perspectives (viewpoints) during iterative refinement cycles.

### Exam Questions
- **List the six rights that are exclusively exercised by copyright holders**  Reproduction, distribution, public performance, public display, derivative works, digital audio transmission (sound recordings).
- **List the four factors that characterize fair use**  Purpose and character, nature of the work, amount/substantiality, effect on market value.
- **Analyze the ethical implications of data collection by social media platforms**  Tensions: personalization vs surveillance, consent clarity, data minimization, algorithmic bias, secondary use without informed user control.
- **Evaluate data privacy and ethical considerations in database design**  Minimize data collection, apply encryption (at rest, in transit), role‑based access, retention limits, consent tracking, audit logging, anonymization/pseudonymization.
- **Evaluate the credibility and reliability of online information sources**  Assess source authority, evidence citation, corroboration by independent outlets, update history, potential conflicts of interest, and bias indicators.
