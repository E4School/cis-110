question: "What are the basic steps in the programming process from writing code to running a program?"
answer: "The programming process involves several key steps: \n**1. Writing Source Code** - Programmer writes instructions in a high-level language using a text editor or IDE. \n**2. Compilation/Translation** - A compiler or interpreter processes the source code, checking for syntax errors and translating it to machine code or preparing it for execution. \n**3. Loading** - The operating system loads the program from storage into memory. \n**4. Execution** - The CPU fetches, decodes, and executes the machine code instructions one by one. \n**5. Runtime** - The program runs, potentially interacting with users, reading files, or communicating over networks. Each step transforms the human-readable code into something the computer can execute."
