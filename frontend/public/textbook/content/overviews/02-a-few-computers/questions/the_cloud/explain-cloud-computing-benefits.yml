question: "What is cloud computing and how does it benefit everyday users?"
answer: "Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services (storage, software, processing power) over the internet instead of using only local devices. Benefits for everyday users include: accessing files from any device with internet connection, automatic backups and synchronization, reduced need for expensive hardware, access to powerful software without installation, and collaboration features that allow multiple people to work on the same documents simultaneously. Examples include Google Drive, iCloud, and Microsoft OneDrive."
