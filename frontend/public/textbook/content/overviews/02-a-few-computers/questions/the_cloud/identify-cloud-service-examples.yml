question: "Give three examples of cloud services that you might use in daily life and explain what each one does."
answer: "Three common cloud services are: 1) Google Drive/Dropbox - cloud storage services that let you save files online and access them from any device, 2) Netflix/Spotify - streaming services that deliver entertainment content over the internet without requiring local storage, and 3) Gmail/Outlook.com - email services that store and manage your email messages on remote servers rather than on your computer. These services demonstrate how cloud computing provides storage, entertainment, and communication capabilities through internet-connected servers."
