question: "Define basic database terminology: records, rows, columns, and tables"
answer: "Database terminology describes how information is organized: A **table** is like a spreadsheet that stores related data (e.g., customer information). A **row** (also called a record) contains all the information about one item (e.g., one customer's complete details). A **column** represents one type of information across all rows (e.g., all customer names). A **record** is another term for a row - it's a complete set of related data. For example, in a customer table: each row/record represents one customer, and columns/fields include name, email, phone number, and address."
