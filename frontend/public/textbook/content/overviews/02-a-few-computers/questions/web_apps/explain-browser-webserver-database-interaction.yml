question: "Explain how a browser, webserver, and database interact"
answer: "The three components work together to deliver dynamic web content: 1) **Browser** sends a request to the webserver when you visit a website or submit a form. 2) **Webserver** receives the request and determines if it needs data from the database. If so, it queries the database for the required information. 3) **Database** processes the query and returns the requested data to the webserver. 4) **Webserver** takes the database results, formats them into HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and sends the complete webpage back to the browser. 5) **Browser** displays the webpage with the database information. For example, when you search for products on an e-commerce site, your browser requests search results, the webserver queries the product database, and the database returns matching products that get displayed in your browser."
