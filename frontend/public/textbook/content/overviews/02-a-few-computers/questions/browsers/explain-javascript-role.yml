question: "Explain the role of JavaScript in a Web page"
answer: "JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. While HTML provides structure and CSS handles styling, JavaScript makes web pages respond to user actions like clicks, form submissions, mouse movements, and keyboard input. JavaScript can modify HTML content in real-time, change CSS styles, validate form data, create animations, handle user events, and communicate with web servers without reloading the page. Examples include dropdown menus, image carousels, interactive maps, real-time chat, and form validation. JavaScript transforms static web pages into interactive applications, enabling modern web experiences like social media feeds, online games, and web-based productivity tools."
