question: "What is an IP address and why is it important for internet communication?"
answer: "An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical identifier assigned to every device connected to a network, similar to a postal address for mail delivery. It's important because it allows computers to find and communicate with each other across the internet. When you visit a website, your computer uses the website's IP address to locate the correct server and request the web pages. IP addresses ensure that data packets are delivered to the right destination in the vast network of interconnected computers."
