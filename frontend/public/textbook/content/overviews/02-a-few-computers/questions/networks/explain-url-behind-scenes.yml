question: "Explain what happens 'behind the scenes' when you access a URL in your browser"
answer: "When you type a URL like 'www.example.com' and press Enter, several steps happen automatically: \n**1. DNS Lookup** - Your browser contacts a DNS (Domain Name System) server to translate the human-readable domain name into an IP address (like 192.168.1.1). \n**2. Connection** - Your browser establishes a connection to the web server at that IP address using HTTP or HTTPS protocol. \n**3. Request** - Your browser sends an HTTP request asking for the specific webpage or resource. \n**4. Server Processing** - The web server receives the request, processes it, and prepares the response (HTML, CSS, images, etc.). \n**5. Response** - The server sends the webpage data back to your browser. \n**6. Rendering** - Your browser receives the data and renders it into the visual webpage you see. This entire process typically happens in seconds, involving multiple computers and network infrastructure working together seamlessly."
