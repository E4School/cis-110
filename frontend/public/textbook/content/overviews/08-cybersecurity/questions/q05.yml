question: "Explain what a rootkit is"
answer: "A rootkit is a particularly dangerous type of malware designed to hide its presence on a computer system by operating at the deepest levels of the operating system, often at the kernel or root level, making it extremely difficult to detect and remove. Rootkits modify core system functions to conceal malicious processes, files, network connections, and registry entries from both users and security software. They typically gain access through security vulnerabilities, infected downloads, or social engineering attacks, then install themselves with administrative privileges. Once installed, rootkits can provide persistent backdoor access to attackers, steal sensitive information like passwords and financial data, log keystrokes, monitor user activity, and serve as a platform for installing additional malware. The stealth capabilities of rootkits make them particularly concerning because they can operate undetected for extended periods while compromising system security. Detection requires specialized anti-rootkit tools that can examine system behavior at low levels, and removal often requires booting from external media or completely reinstalling the operating system. Prevention focuses on maintaining updated security software, avoiding suspicious downloads, and using standard user accounts rather than administrator accounts for daily activities."
