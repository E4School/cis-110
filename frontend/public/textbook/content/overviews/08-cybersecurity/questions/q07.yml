question: "Describe how an online intrusion takes place"
answer: "An online intrusion typically follows a structured process that attackers use to gain unauthorized access to systems or networks. **Reconnaissance** begins the attack as criminals research targets through public information, social media, company websites, and network scanning to identify potential vulnerabilities and entry points. **Initial access** is gained through various methods like phishing emails with malicious links or attachments, exploiting unpatched software vulnerabilities, using stolen credentials from data breaches, or social engineering to trick users into providing access. **Persistence establishment** involves installing backdoors, creating new user accounts, or implanting malware that survives system reboots to maintain long-term access. **Privilege escalation** allows attackers to gain higher-level permissions by exploiting additional vulnerabilities or using legitimate tools inappropriately. **Lateral movement** spreads the intrusion across the network as attackers explore connected systems, steal additional credentials, and access more valuable resources. **Data exfiltration or damage** represents the final objective, whether stealing sensitive information, installing ransomware, disrupting operations, or establishing persistent criminal infrastructure. Throughout this process, attackers work to avoid detection by using legitimate tools, encrypting communications, and covering their tracks. Understanding this process helps organizations implement layered security defenses at each stage."
