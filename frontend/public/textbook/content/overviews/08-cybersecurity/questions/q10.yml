question: "Explain what spoofing is"
answer: "Spoofing is a cybersecurity attack technique where criminals disguise their identity or the source of their communications to appear as a trusted entity, tricking victims into believing they're interacting with someone legitimate. **Email spoofing** involves forging email headers to make messages appear to come from trusted sources like banks, colleagues, or service providers, often used for phishing attacks. **IP spoofing** modifies packet headers to hide the true source of network traffic, making it appear to originate from a trusted IP address, commonly used in denial-of-service attacks. **Website spoofing** creates fake websites that closely mimic legitimate ones to steal login credentials or personal information. **Caller ID spoofing** displays false phone numbers to make calls appear to come from trusted sources like banks or government agencies. **DNS spoofing** redirects users to malicious websites by corrupting the translation between domain names and IP addresses. **MAC address spoofing** changes network adapter identifiers to bypass network access controls. Spoofing attacks exploit trust relationships and human psychology, making them particularly effective. Protection involves verifying the authenticity of unexpected communications through independent channels, using multi-factor authentication, implementing email authentication protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), and maintaining awareness of spoofing techniques to recognize potential attacks."
