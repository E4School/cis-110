question: "Explain what social engineering is"
answer: "Social engineering is a cybersecurity attack method that manipulates human psychology and behavior to trick people into divulging confidential information, performing actions, or providing access to secure systems, rather than exploiting technical vulnerabilities. Attackers leverage psychological principles like authority (impersonating executives or IT support), urgency (creating false deadlines or emergencies), fear (threatening consequences), trust (building relationships over time), and helpfulness (exploiting people's desire to assist others). **Common techniques** include phishing emails that appear to come from trusted sources, pretexting where attackers create false scenarios to extract information, baiting with infected USB drives or free downloads, tailgating to gain physical access by following authorized personnel, and quid pro quo offers of services in exchange for information or access. **Phone-based attacks** might involve fake tech support calls or impersonation of bank representatives requesting account verification. Social engineering is particularly effective because it targets the weakest link in security systems: human nature. **Defense strategies** include security awareness training to help people recognize manipulation tactics, establishing verification procedures for sensitive requests, implementing policies that separate authorization from execution, and creating a culture where questioning suspicious requests is encouraged rather than discouraged."
