question: "Identify common malware exploits"
answer: "Common malware exploits target predictable vulnerabilities in systems and user behavior. **Email attachments** remain a primary vector, using malicious documents with macros, fake invoices, or executable files disguised as legitimate content. **Drive-by downloads** exploit browser vulnerabilities to automatically install malware when visiting compromised websites, often through malicious ads or embedded scripts. **Software vulnerabilities** target unpatched security flaws in operating systems, browsers, and popular applications like Adobe Flash or Java. **USB and removable media** can carry autorun malware that executes when connected to systems. **Social engineering** exploits human psychology through fake software updates, tech support scams, or urgent security warnings that trick users into downloading malware. **Pirated software and illegal downloads** often contain hidden malware bundled with desired content. **Phishing emails** direct users to malicious websites that either download malware or steal credentials for later attacks. **Network vulnerabilities** allow worms to spread across connected systems without user interaction. **Macro-enabled documents** in Office files can execute malicious code when opened. Protection involves keeping software updated, using reputable antivirus solutions, enabling email filters, avoiding suspicious downloads, and educating users about social engineering tactics."
