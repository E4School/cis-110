question: "List four techniques for dealing with cyberbullies"
answer: "Four effective techniques for dealing with cyberbullies are: 1) Document and save evidence (screenshots, messages) before blocking or reporting, 2) Block the bully on all platforms and report them to the website/app administrators, 3) Don't engage or respond to the bullying behavior, as this often escalates the situation, and 4) Seek support from trusted adults, friends, or counselors who can provide guidance and emotional help. Additional strategies include adjusting privacy settings to limit who can contact you and taking breaks from social media when needed to protect your mental health."
