question: "List the four factors that characterize fair use"
answer: "The four factors that determine fair use are: 1) The purpose and character of the use (commercial vs. educational, transformative nature), 2) The nature of the copyrighted work (factual vs. creative, published vs. unpublished), 3) The amount and substantiality of the portion used (how much of the original work was used), and 4) The effect of the use on the market or value of the original work (does it harm the creator's ability to profit). Courts consider all four factors together when determining if a use qualifies as fair use, which allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes like criticism, comment, teaching, or research."
