question: "Explain what a rootkit is"
answer: "A rootkit is a type of malware designed to hide its presence on a computer system by modifying the operating system itself. Unlike other malware that can be detected by antivirus software, rootkits gain deep, administrative-level access (called 'root' access) and modify system files to conceal themselves. They can hide processes, files, and network connections from normal detection methods. Rootkits are particularly dangerous because they can remain undetected for long periods while allowing attackers to maintain persistent access to the compromised system, steal data, or install additional malware."
