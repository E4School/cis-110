question: "Describe how an online intrusion takes place"
answer: "An online intrusion typically follows these steps: 1) Reconnaissance - attackers gather information about the target (through social media, company websites, or network scanning), 2) Initial access - using exploits like phishing emails, malware, or exploiting software vulnerabilities to gain entry, 3) Privilege escalation - expanding access from limited user accounts to administrative control, 4) Persistence - installing backdoors or rootkits to maintain access even after discovery, 5) Data collection - searching for valuable information like passwords, financial data, or trade secrets, and 6) Exfiltration - secretly copying and removing stolen data from the system. Throughout this process, attackers try to avoid detection by security systems and administrators."
