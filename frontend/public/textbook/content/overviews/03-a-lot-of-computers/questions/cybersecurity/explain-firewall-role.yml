question: "Explain the role of a firewall"
answer: "A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls network traffic between a computer (or network) and the internet, acting like a digital security guard. It examines incoming and outgoing data packets and decides whether to allow or block them based on predetermined security rules. Firewalls can block malicious traffic, prevent unauthorized access to your system, and stop malware from communicating with external servers. They can be software-based (running on your computer) or hardware-based (separate devices protecting entire networks). Modern firewalls can also detect suspicious patterns of activity and provide detailed logs of network traffic for security analysis."
