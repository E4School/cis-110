question: "Explain what a zero-day exploit is"
answer: "A zero-day exploit is an attack that takes advantage of a previously unknown security vulnerability in software before the developers have had time to create and distribute a fix (patch). It's called 'zero-day' because developers have had zero days to address the vulnerability since it was discovered by attackers. These exploits are particularly dangerous because no defense exists against them initially - antivirus software doesn't recognize them, and no security patches are available. Zero-day exploits are valuable to cybercriminals and can be sold on dark markets. Once discovered, it becomes a race between attackers using the exploit and developers creating a patch."
