question: "Identify common malware exploits"
answer: "Common malware exploits include: 1) Email attachments containing infected files that activate when opened, 2) Malicious downloads from untrusted websites or file-sharing networks, 3) Software vulnerabilities where malware exploits security flaws in outdated programs, 4) USB drives and removable media that auto-execute malware when connected, 5) Social engineering attacks that trick users into installing fake software updates or security tools, and 6) Drive-by downloads where simply visiting a compromised website can install malware. These exploits succeed by taking advantage of human behavior (clicking suspicious links) or technical weaknesses (unpatched software)."
