question: "Explain what malware is"
answer: "Malware (malicious software) is any software intentionally designed to cause damage, steal information, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. Common types include viruses (that spread by attaching to other files), worms (that spread automatically across networks), trojans (that disguise themselves as legitimate software), ransomware (that encrypts files and demands payment), and spyware (that secretly monitors user activity). Malware can slow down computers, steal personal information like passwords and credit card numbers, delete important files, or give criminals remote control of infected devices."
