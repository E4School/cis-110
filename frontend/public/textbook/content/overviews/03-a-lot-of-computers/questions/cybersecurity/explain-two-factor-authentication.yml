question: "Explain what two-factor authentication is"
answer: "Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security method that requires two different forms of verification to access an account, rather than just a password. The two factors typically include something you know (like a password) and something you have (like your phone or a security token). For example, after entering your password, you might receive a text message with a code to enter, or use an authenticator app to generate a temporary code. This makes accounts much more secure because even if someone steals your password, they would still need access to your second factor (like your phone) to log in."
