question: "Discuss issues with creating a strong password"
answer: "Creating strong passwords presents several challenges: they must be long enough (12+ characters) and complex (mixing letters, numbers, symbols) to resist guessing attacks, but this makes them hard to remember. People often reuse passwords across multiple accounts for convenience, but this means one breach compromises all accounts. Strong passwords should be unique for each account, but managing dozens of unique complex passwords is difficult without tools. Additionally, passwords need to be changed periodically, and some systems have confusing requirements (like requiring but limiting certain special characters). Password managers help solve these issues by generating and storing unique strong passwords for each account."
