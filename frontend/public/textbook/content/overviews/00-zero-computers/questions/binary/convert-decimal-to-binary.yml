question: "Convert the decimal number 13 to binary"
answer: "To convert 13 to binary, we repeatedly divide by 2 and track the remainders: 13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1, 6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0, 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1, 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1. Reading the remainders from bottom to top gives us 1101. We can verify: 1×8 + 1×4 + 0×2 + 1×1 = 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13. Therefore, 13 in decimal equals 1101 in binary."
