question: "How might letters and words be encoded numerically?"
answer: "Letters and words are encoded numerically using standardized systems like ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). Each letter is assigned a unique number - for example, the letter 'A' is represented by the number 65, and 'a' is represented by 97. To spell a word like 'Hi', the computer stores the numeric codes for 'H' (72) followed by 'i' (105). By agreeing on these standard number assignments, all computers can understand and display the same text when they read the numeric patterns. This system allows any written character to be represented as a simple number."
