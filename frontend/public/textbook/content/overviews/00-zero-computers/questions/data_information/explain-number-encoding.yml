question: "How might a regular (non-binary) number be encoded in binary?"
answer: "Regular decimal numbers can be encoded in binary in several ways. The most direct method is converting the decimal number to its binary equivalent (like 13 becomes 1101). However, if the number appears as text (like typing '13' in a document), each digit character is encoded separately using ASCII - the character '1' becomes 00110001 and '3' becomes 00110011. For decimal numbers with fractional parts (like 3.14), computers use floating-point encoding which stores the number in scientific notation using separate sections for the sign, exponent, and mantissa. The encoding method depends on whether the number is used for calculations (direct binary conversion) or for display as text (ASCII encoding)."
