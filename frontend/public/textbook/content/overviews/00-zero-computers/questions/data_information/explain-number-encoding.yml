question: "How can numbers be encoded in binary, and what's the difference from the binary number system itself?"
answer: "Numbers can be encoded in binary in different ways depending on their purpose. The binary number system directly represents quantities (like 1010 = 10), but numbers can also be encoded as text using ASCII. For example, the digit '5' as text is encoded as 00110101 (ASCII code 53), which is different from the number 5 in pure binary (101). Additionally, computers use special encoding for negative numbers (two's complement), decimal numbers (floating-point), and very large numbers. The encoding method depends on how the number will be used - for math calculations versus text display."
