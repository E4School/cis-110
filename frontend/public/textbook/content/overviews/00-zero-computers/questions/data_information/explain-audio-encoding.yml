question: "How might audio be represented numerically?"
answer: "Audio can be represented numerically by measuring and storing sound wave amplitudes at regular time intervals. This process, called sampling, captures thousands of numeric measurements per second - typically 44,100 samples per second for CD quality audio. Each sample records how far the sound wave has moved from its resting position at that precise moment, storing this as a number (often between -32,768 and +32,767). To recreate the sound, the computer reads these numbers in sequence and moves a speaker cone to match each stored amplitude value. For stereo sound, the computer stores separate numeric sequences for left and right audio channels, synchronized to play simultaneously."
