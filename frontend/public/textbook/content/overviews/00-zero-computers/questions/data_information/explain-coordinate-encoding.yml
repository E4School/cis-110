question: "How might a pair of numbers, like a 2D-coordinate, be encoded as a single number?"
answer: "A coordinate pair like (7,2) can be encoded as a single number using mathematical techniques. One common method is to use a formula like: single_number = x + (y × max_x_value). For example, if we know x-coordinates go from 0-99, we could encode (7,2) as: 7 + (2 × 100) = 207. To decode, we reverse the process: x = 207 % 100 = 7, and y = 207 ÷ 100 = 2."
