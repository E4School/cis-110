question: "How might a pair of numbers, like a 2D-coordinate, be encoded as a single number?"
answer: "A coordinate pair like (7,2) can be encoded as a single number using mathematical techniques. One common method is to use a formula like: single_number = x + (y × max_x_value). For example, if we know x-coordinates go from 0-99, we could encode (7,2) as: 7 + (2 × 100) = 207. To decode, we reverse the process: x = 207 % 100 = 7, and y = 207 ÷ 100 = 2."

answer_kindergarten: "Sometimes we need to turn two numbers into one number! It's like putting two toys in one box. If you have a point at (3,1) - that's 3 steps to the right and 1 step up - we can make it into just one number like 13. We use a special trick: take the first number (3), then add it to the second number (1) times 10, so 3 + (1 × 10) = 13. When we want our two numbers back, we can split 13 apart again!"

answer_3rd_grade: "A coordinate like (7,2) is two numbers that tell you where something is - 7 steps right and 2 steps up. We can combine these into one number using math! One way is: take the first number (7) and add it to the second number (2) multiplied by a big enough number like 100. So (7,2) becomes 7 + (2 × 100) = 207. To get our coordinates back, we divide 207 by 100 to get 2 for the up direction, and find the remainder (7) for the right direction."

answer_7th_grade: "Coordinate encoding converts a pair of numbers into a single number while preserving the ability to recover the original values. The most common method uses positional encoding: single_number = x + (y × range). For coordinates (7,2) with x-values from 0-99, we calculate 7 + (2 × 100) = 207. This works because each y-value gets its own 'slot' of 100 numbers. To decode 207: y = 207 ÷ 100 = 2 (integer division), and x = 207 % 100 = 7 (remainder)."

answer_high_school: "Coordinate pair encoding transforms two-dimensional spatial information into one-dimensional numerical representation using bijective mathematical functions. Linear encoding allocates fixed ranges: f(x,y) = x + y×(max_x + 1), ensuring unique mapping when x ∈ [0, max_x]."
