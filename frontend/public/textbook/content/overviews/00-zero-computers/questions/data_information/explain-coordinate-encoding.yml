question: "How might a pair of numbers, like a coordinate (7,2), be encoded in binary?"
answer: "A coordinate pair like (7,2) can be encoded in binary by converting each number separately and then combining them with a clear structure. First, convert each coordinate to binary: 7 becomes 111 and 2 becomes 10. Then store them sequentially with enough bits for each coordinate - for example, using 8 bits each: 00000111 00000010. The decoder needs to know the format beforehand (like 'first 8 bits are x-coordinate, next 8 bits are y-coordinate')."
