question: "How can colors be encoded in binary?"
answer: "Colors are encoded in binary using numerical values for different color components. The most common system is RGB (Red, Green, Blue), where each color component is represented by a number from 0-255 (requiring 8 bits each). For example, pure red might be encoded as Red=255, Green=0, Blue=0, which in binary is 11111111 00000000 00000000. Black is 0,0,0 (all zeros) and white is 255,255,255 (all ones). By combining different intensities of red, green, and blue light, computers can create millions of different colors. Each pixel on your screen displays the color specified by its RGB binary code."
