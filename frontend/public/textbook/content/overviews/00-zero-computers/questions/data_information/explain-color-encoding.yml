question: "How might colors be encoded numerically?"
answer: "Colors can be encoded numerically using the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) system, where each color component is represented by a number from 0-255. For example, pure red is encoded as Red=255, Green=0, Blue=0. Black is represented as (0,0,0) and white as (255,255,255). By varying the intensity values for each primary color component, computers can represent millions of different colors. Each pixel on your screen displays the color specified by its three numeric RGB values. This numerical approach allows precise color specification and consistent color reproduction across different devices."
