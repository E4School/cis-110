# Hardware Vocabulary

## Core Concepts

**Computer system (system)** - A coordinated collection of hardware and software components working together

**Hardware / Software boundary** - The interface between physical components and program instructions

**IPOS model (Input, Processing, Output, Storage)** - The fundamental model describing computer operations

## Input/Output
**Input device** - Hardware that accepts data from users or environment  
**Output device** - Hardware that presents processed information to users or other systems

## Processing Components
**Control unit** - Coordinates instruction execution and manages data flow  
**ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)** - Performs mathematical and logical operations  
**Program counter (PC)** - Tracks the address of the next instruction to execute

## Memory and Storage
**Register** - Fastest memory directly within the CPU  
**Cache** - High-speed memory buffer between CPU and main memory  
**Main memory (RAM)** - Primary working memory for active programs  
**RAM (volatile)** - Memory that loses content when power is removed  
**ROM (Read-Only Memory)** - Non-volatile memory containing permanent instructions  
**Firmware** - Low-level software stored in non-volatile memory  
**Storage (persistent storage)** - Long-term data retention devices

## Program Execution
**Stored program concept** - Instructions stored in memory alongside data  
**Instruction** - A single command the processor can execute  
**Opcode** - The operation code specifying what action to perform  
**Machine cycle (fetch–decode–execute)** - The basic cycle of instruction processing

## System Startup
**Boot / Bootstrap** - Process of starting up a computer system  
**Loader** - Program that loads other programs into memory  
**Device driver** - Software that controls specific hardware components

## Architecture
**Bus (data / address / control)** - Communication pathways between components  
**System on a Chip (SoC)** - Integration of multiple components on single chip  
**Embedded system** - Computer system designed for specific functions  
**Architecture (desktop, mobile, embedded)** - Different design approaches for different use cases

## Performance Concepts
**Performance (throughput, latency)** - Measures of system speed and responsiveness  
**Throughput** - Amount of work completed per unit time  
**Latency** - Time delay for a single operation  
**Bottleneck** - Component that limits overall system performance  
**Scalability (vertical, horizontal)** - Ability to handle increased load  
**Efficiency** - Ratio of useful work to resources consumed

## Design Considerations
**Energy efficiency** - Minimizing power consumption  
**Power consumption** - Amount of electrical energy used  
**Thermal constraints** - Heat dissipation limitations  
**Trade-off** - Balancing competing design goals  
**Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** - Complete cost including purchase, operation, maintenance  
**Benchmark** - Standardized test for measuring performance  
**Metric** - Measurable quantity used for evaluation  
**Optimization** - Improving system performance  
**Premature optimization** - Optimizing without proper analysis (antipattern)

## Data Movement
**Data path** - Route data takes through the system  
**Data flow** - Movement and transformation of data through components
