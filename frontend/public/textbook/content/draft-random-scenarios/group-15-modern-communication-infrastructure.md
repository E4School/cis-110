# GROUP 15: Modern Communication Infrastructure

**ROGER (Systems Architect):** "The **abstraction** layer is hiding critical **file path** information from users. **Notifications** over **5G** networks break when systems are **multitasking**."

**SARA (Mobile Developer):** "Users don't want to see file paths. They want notifications that work reliably, regardless of network speed or system load."

**ROGER:** "But hiding system details makes debugging impossible. When something breaks, we can't even tell users where the problem occurred."

**SARA:** "That's our problem, not theirs. Good design means users never need to understand file paths or network protocols."

**ROGER:** "Good design that's impossible to maintain isn't really good design. We need visibility into system operations."

**SARA:** "We need better error handling, not more technical exposure for end users."
