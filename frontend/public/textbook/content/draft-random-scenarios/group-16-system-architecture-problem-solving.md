# GROUP 16: System Architecture Problem-Solving

**TOM (Hardware Engineer):** "The **computer** processor can't handle these **conditional** statements efficiently. Data routing through the **router** creates bottlenecks, and **SQL** queries generate constant **error messages**."

**URSULA (Software Engineer):** "That's a software optimization problem, not hardware. Better query design would eliminate most of those error messages."

**TOM:** "No, the hardware is fundamentally limited. These processors weren't designed for this workload."

**URSULA:** "Or your network configuration is wrong. I've seen identical hardware handle twice this load with proper software tuning."

**TOM:** "Software tuning can't fix physical limitations. We need faster processors."

**URSULA:** "And I think we need smarter programming. Let's benchmark both approaches before spending money on new hardware."
