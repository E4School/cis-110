# GROUP 27: Development Process Management

**BACKSTORY:** CodeFlow Technologies discovered that their **version control** system creates **code review** bottlenecks when **pull request** workflows conflict with **continuous integration** pipelines, causing **version control** merges to fail during **code review** automation while **pull request** approvals wait for **continuous integration** validation. Peter's **version control** engineering team found that **code review** automation triggers **pull request** conflicts when **continuous integration** builds modify **version control** state during **code review** processing, while Quinn's development operations team argued that **continuous integration** **pull request** validation requires **version control** **code review** integration to maintain pipeline reliability. The **version control** system was designed to support **code review** **pull request** **continuous integration** workflows simultaneously, but **version control** state changes during **continuous integration** processing create **code review** **pull request** conflicts that require manual intervention. Peter discovered that **pull request** **code review** automation fails when **continuous integration** systems modify **version control** branches during **code review** validation, creating **pull request** approval deadlocks. Quinn argues that **continuous integration** **version control** integration is essential for **code review** **pull request** quality assurance, while Peter insists that **version control** **code review** **pull request** **continuous integration** conflicts indicate fundamental workflow design problems. The development team faces release deadline pressure if **code review** **pull request** **version control** **continuous integration** workflow efficiency doesn't improve.

**PETER (Version Control Engineer):** "**Code review** automation creates **pull request** conflicts when **continuous integration** modifies **version control** state during **code review** processing."

**QUINN (DevOps Engineer):** "**Continuous integration** **pull request** validation requires **version control** **code review** integration. Pipeline reliability depends on **code review** **pull request** **continuous integration** coordination."

**PETER:** "**Version control** state changes during **continuous integration** break **code review** **pull request** workflows. **Code review** automation fails when **continuous integration** modifies branches."

**QUINN:** "That's a **version control** **code review** timing problem. **Pull request** **continuous integration** validation should happen before **code review** **version control** merges."

**PETER:** "**Code review** **pull request** deadlocks occur when **continuous integration** **version control** operations conflict. **Code review** automation can't handle **pull request** **continuous integration** race conditions."

**QUINN:** "**Continuous integration** **version control** **code review** **pull request** workflows need better coordination, not separation. Integration drives development quality."

### Critical Thinking Questions:
- Why would continuous integration systems modify version control state during code review? Modern CI/CD platforms create separate build artifacts and test results without modifying the source branches under review.
- Code review and CI validation typically happen in parallel or sequence, not in conflict. Systems like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins are specifically designed to avoid the race conditions described here.
- The workflow described suggests poor branching strategy and CI configuration. Professional development teams use feature branches, status checks, and merge protections to coordinate code review and CI without conflicts.
