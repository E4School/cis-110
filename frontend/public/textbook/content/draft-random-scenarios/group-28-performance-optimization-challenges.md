# GROUP 28: Performance Optimization Challenges

**BACKSTORY:** SpeedTech Optimizations built their **caching** system to improve **performance** through **load balancing** and **memory** optimization, but their **server** infrastructure creates **latency** problems when **caching** algorithms conflict with **load balancing** decisions during peak **performance** demands. Rachel's **performance** engineering team discovered that **caching** strategies interfere with **load balancing** when **server** **memory** limitations force **caching** eviction during **performance** optimization cycles, while Sam's infrastructure team argued that **server** **load balancing** decisions should prioritize **performance** over **caching** **memory** efficiency. The **performance** system was designed to balance **caching** **load balancing** **server** **memory** optimization automatically, but **performance** peaks create **caching** **load balancing** conflicts that increase **latency** across **server** infrastructure. Rachel found that **load balancing** algorithms prioritize **server** availability over **caching** efficiency, creating **memory** pressure that degrades **performance** through increased **latency**. Sam argues that **server** reliability requires **load balancing** decisions that sometimes conflict with **caching** **performance** optimization, while Rachel insists that **performance** **caching** **memory** efficiency should drive **load balancing** **server** **latency** management. The platform faces service level agreement violations if **performance** **latency** doesn't improve, but **caching** **load balancing** **server** **memory** optimization complexity exceeds current **performance** infrastructure capabilities.

**RACHEL (Performance Engineer):** "**Caching** strategies conflict with **load balancing** decisions. **Server** **memory** limitations create **performance** degradation through increased **latency**."

**SAM (Infrastructure Engineer):** "**Server** reliability requires **load balancing** that sometimes conflicts with **caching** **performance**. **Memory** optimization can't compromise **server** availability."

**RACHEL:** "**Performance** peaks force **caching** eviction when **load balancing** spreads **memory** pressure across **server** infrastructure. **Latency** increases when **caching** fails."

**SAM:** "**Load balancing** **server** decisions prioritize availability over **caching** efficiency. **Performance** optimization shouldn't risk **server** stability through **memory** **latency** management."

**RACHEL:** "**Caching** **performance** efficiency drives user experience. **Load balancing** **server** **memory** **latency** coordination needs **performance** optimization priority."

**SAM:** "**Server** infrastructure stability enables **performance**. **Caching** **load balancing** **memory** optimization should adapt to **server** **latency** constraints, not dictate them."

### Critical Thinking Questions:
- Why would caching strategies conflict with load balancing? Modern systems use consistent hashing, cache-aware load balancing, and distributed caching specifically to coordinate these functions effectively.
- Memory pressure causing cache eviction during peak loads indicates poor capacity planning, not inherent conflicts between caching and load balancing. Professional systems use cache warming, predictive scaling, and memory management.
- The choice between server reliability and performance optimization is false. Modern cloud platforms use auto-scaling, health checks, and circuit breakers to maintain both availability and performance without compromise.
