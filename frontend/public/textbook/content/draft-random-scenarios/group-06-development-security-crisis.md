# GROUP 6: Development Security Crisis

**Vocabulary:** API endpoints, analytics pipeline, video streaming, vulnerability scanning, security patches

**BACKSTORY:** StreamTech's video platform processes millions of daily transactions through Kumar's **API endpoints**, with Elena's **analytics pipeline** providing real-time business intelligence for executive decisions. Their automated **vulnerability scanning** identified a critical security flaw in a widely-used authentication library that powers Kumar's **video streaming** services, requiring immediate **security patches** that could disrupt the **analytics pipeline**. The vulnerability affects **API endpoints** handling user authentication for **video streaming**, but patching immediately would break compatibility with Elena's **analytics pipeline** that feeds revenue dashboards. Elena's **analytics pipeline** processes terabytes of **video streaming** data for content licensing decisions and advertiser metrics, but **security patches** would require system downtime during peak traffic hours. The crisis escalated when **vulnerability scanning** revealed the authentication flaw was being actively exploited, potentially compromising user data flowing through the **analytics pipeline**. Kumar needs 48 hours to implement **security patches** while maintaining **API endpoints** functionality, but Elena's **video streaming** analytics are essential for tomorrow's board presentation. The CEO demands immediate **vulnerability scanning** remediation without disrupting business-critical **analytics pipeline** operations.

**KUMAR (Backend Developer):** "Our **vulnerability scanning** flagged a critical auth library flaw affecting **video streaming** **API endpoints**. **Security patches** are available but require system downtime."

**ELENA (Business Analyst):** "Can you patch the **API endpoints** without breaking my **analytics pipeline**? I need **video streaming** metrics for tomorrow's board presentation."

**KUMAR:** "The **security patches** require authentication framework updates. Rushing deployment could break **API endpoints** and corrupt your **analytics pipeline** data."

**ELENA:** "So we run **video streaming** services with known vulnerabilities? That's worse than delayed analytics - it's a potential **vulnerability scanning** nightmare."

**KUMAR:** "I'm saying **security patches** need proper testing. Rushing **API endpoints** updates while our **analytics pipeline** depends on stable **video streaming** creates more risks."

**ELENA:** "But without my **analytics pipeline** running, we can't show **video streaming** revenue metrics. The **API endpoints** have to work despite the **vulnerability scanning** situation."
