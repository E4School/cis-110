# GROUP 25: JavaScript Security and Data Visualization  

**ADAM (Web Developer):** "The **JavaScript** code for our **Internet** platform manages database **records** through **VPN** connections, but the **charts and graphs** are loading too slowly."

**BETTY (Security Lead):** "VPN overhead is the price of security. If you want faster charts, sacrifice data protection - but don't blame me when we get breached."

**ADAM:** "There has to be a middle ground. Users won't wait 30 seconds for a simple bar chart to load."

**BETTY:** "Then optimize your JavaScript instead of asking me to weaken security protocols. The VPN stays."

**ADAM:** "I've optimized everything I can. The bottleneck is your security infrastructure, not my code."

**BETTY:** "My 'security infrastructure' is what keeps us in business. Your fast charts won't matter if hackers steal everything."
