# Algorithm - Exam Questions

Generated on 2025-09-03 11:06:35

Here are 3 multiple-choice exam questions on the topic:

1) Which statement best defines an algorithm?
- A) Any code written in a specific programming language that compiles successfully
- B) A clear, finite sequence of unambiguous steps that transforms input into output, independent of language
- C) A set of heuristics that may or may not terminate
- D) A data structure used to store information
Correct answer: B

2) Which of the following procedures fails to meet a key property of a “good” algorithm?
- A) A contact-sorting method that always finishes and correctly orders names
- B) A map route finder that sometimes loops forever when there is no path
- C) A passcode check that compares the entered code to the stored code
- D) A search that uses extra memory to run faster
Correct answer: B

3) A team is choosing between two correct algorithms to process large datasets: Algorithm X runs fast but uses a lot of memory; Algorithm Y runs slower but uses little memory. This choice best illustrates:
- A) Algorithms must be written in the same language as the data
- B) Efficiency only concerns speed, not memory
- C) Trade-offs between time and space efficiency in algorithm design
- D) The need for algorithms to be infinite to handle big data
Correct answer: C
