question: "Explain what encryption is"
answer: "Encryption is the process of converting readable information (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using mathematical algorithms and encryption keys, making data secure from unauthorized access. The primary purpose is to protect sensitive information during storage or transmission by ensuring that even if intercepted, the data cannot be understood without the proper decryption key. There are two main types: symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption (faster but requires secure key sharing), while asymmetric encryption uses different keys for encryption and decryption (more secure for key distribution but slower). Encryption is essential for protecting personal data, financial transactions, communications, and stored files. Modern encryption standards like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) are virtually unbreakable with current technology when properly implemented. Encryption forms the foundation of digital security, enabling secure online banking, messaging, e-commerce, and data protection."
