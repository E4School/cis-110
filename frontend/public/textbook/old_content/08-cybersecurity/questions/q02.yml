question: "Explain what two-factor authentication is"
answer: "Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security method that requires users to provide two different types of verification before gaining access to an account or system, significantly improving security beyond just using a password. The two factors typically come from different categories: something you know (password, PIN), something you have (smartphone, hardware token, smart card), or something you are (fingerprint, face recognition, retina scan). Common 2FA implementations include receiving SMS text codes, using authenticator apps that generate time-based codes, hardware security keys, or biometric verification. When enabled, even if someone steals your password, they cannot access your account without the second factor. 2FA is crucial for protecting sensitive accounts like email, banking, social media, and work systems. While it adds a small inconvenience, 2FA dramatically reduces the risk of unauthorized access and is considered essential for important accounts in today's digital environment."
