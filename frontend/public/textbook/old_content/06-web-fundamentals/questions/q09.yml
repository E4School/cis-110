question: "Identify 5 common HTML tags and explain what they do"
answer: "Five common HTML tags and their functions are: **&lt;h1&gt;** creates main headings, typically the largest and most prominent text on a page, used for titles and primary section headers. **&lt;p&gt;** defines paragraphs of text, creating the basic building blocks for written content with appropriate spacing above and below. **&lt;a&gt;** creates hyperlinks that connect to other pages, websites, or resources, enabling navigation throughout the web. **&lt;img&gt;** embeds images into web pages, displaying visual content like photographs, illustrations, or graphics. **&lt;div&gt;** creates generic containers or sections that group related content together, often used for layout organization and styling purposes. These tags demonstrate HTML's role in structuring content: headings organize information hierarchically, paragraphs contain text content, links enable navigation, images add visual elements, and divs provide organizational structure."
