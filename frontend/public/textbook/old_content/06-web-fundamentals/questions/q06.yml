question: "Explain what HTTP and HTTPS are"
answer: "HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the foundational communication protocol that governs how web browsers and web servers exchange information over the internet. It defines the format and rules for requesting and delivering web content, including webpages, images, videos, and other resources. HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is the encrypted version of HTTP that adds a security layer using SSL/TLS encryption to protect data transmission between browsers and servers. While HTTP sends data in plain text that can be intercepted and read by third parties, HTTPS encrypts all communication, making it unreadable to eavesdroppers. HTTPS is essential for protecting sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data. Modern browsers display security indicators (like lock icons) for HTTPS sites and warn users about unsecured HTTP connections, especially on pages that handle sensitive information."
