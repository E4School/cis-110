question: "Explain what CSS is"
answer: "CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the styling language that controls the visual presentation and layout of web pages. While HTML defines the structure and content, CSS determines how that content looks - including colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, animations, and responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying style rules to them, using a system of selectors, properties, and values. The 'cascading' aspect means that multiple style rules can apply to the same element, with a hierarchy determining which styles take precedence. CSS enables the separation of content from presentation, allowing developers to maintain consistent visual styling across multiple pages and easily modify the appearance without changing the underlying HTML structure. Modern CSS includes powerful features like flexbox and grid for complex layouts, and media queries for responsive design."
