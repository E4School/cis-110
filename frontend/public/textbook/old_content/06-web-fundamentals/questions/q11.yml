question: "Explain the role of JavaScript in a Web page"
answer: "JavaScript is the programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. While HTML provides structure and CSS handles visual styling, JavaScript enables websites to respond to user actions, update content in real-time, and create engaging interactive experiences. JavaScript can manipulate HTML elements and CSS styles on the fly, validate form inputs before submission, create animations and visual effects, handle user events like clicks and keyboard input, and communicate with web servers to fetch or send data without requiring page reloads (AJAX). Modern JavaScript also powers complex web applications with features like real-time chat, interactive maps, online games, and dynamic content updates. JavaScript runs directly in the user's web browser, making websites feel more like traditional desktop applications rather than static documents."
