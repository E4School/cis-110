question: "List four techniques for dealing with cyberbullies"
answer: "Four effective techniques for dealing with cyberbullies are: **1. Documentation and evidence collection** - Save screenshots, preserve messages, and maintain records of all bullying incidents including dates, times, platforms, and usernames. This evidence is crucial for reporting to authorities, schools, or platforms and can support legal action if necessary. **2. Blocking and privacy controls** - Use platform-specific tools to block the bully's accounts, restrict who can contact you, limit who can see your posts, and adjust privacy settings to prevent the bully from accessing your information or content. **3. Reporting to appropriate authorities** - Report cyberbullying to the social media platform or website where it's occurring, inform school officials if it involves classmates, notify parents or guardians, and contact law enforcement if threats involve physical harm or illegal activities. **4. Seeking support and not engaging** - Avoid responding to or retaliating against cyberbullies as this often escalates the situation; instead, talk to trusted friends, family members, counselors, or teachers for emotional support and guidance. Focus on maintaining your own well-being and don't internalize the bully's harmful messages. Additional strategies include changing usernames or accounts if necessary and taking breaks from social media to reduce exposure to negative interactions."
