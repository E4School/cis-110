question: "List the six rights that are exclusively exercised by copyright holders"
answer: "The six exclusive rights granted to copyright holders under U.S. copyright law are: **1. The right to reproduce** the copyrighted work, meaning only the copyright holder can make copies, including digital copies, photocopies, or any form of duplication. **2. The right to prepare derivative works** based on the original, such as translations, adaptations, sequels, or modifications that transform the original work. **3. The right to distribute** copies of the work to the public through sale, rental, lending, or other transfer of ownership. **4. The right to perform** the work publicly, including live performances, broadcasts, or digital streaming of plays, music, movies, or other performable works. **5. The right to display** the work publicly, such as showing artwork, photographs, or other visual works in galleries, websites, or public spaces. **6. The right to perform sound recordings publicly** through digital audio transmission, which specifically covers streaming services and digital radio broadcasts of recorded music. These rights give copyright holders comprehensive control over how their creative works are used, allowing them to monetize their creations and prevent unauthorized use. Others can only exercise these rights with explicit permission (licensing) from the copyright holder or under specific legal exceptions like fair use."
