# Abstraction - Expanded Definition

Abstraction (noun)

Pronunciation: /æbˈstrækʃən/

Inflections: plural abstractions

Core definition: The action or process of separating, drawing out, or generalizing from particulars; the result of such an act (a concept, quality, or representation removed from concrete specifics).

Senses
1) The act of abstracting; mental removal or separation.
   - The action of considering something independently of its associations, attributes, or concrete instances; a generalization.
   - Example: By careful abstraction, the researcher identified the principle common to all the cases.

2) A state or quality of being abstract; abstractedness.
   - Example: The argument’s abstraction made it hard for newcomers to follow.

3) A general idea or concept formed by mental separation from particulars; an abstract.
   - Example: Justice is an abstraction that guides the court’s deliberations.

4) The act of taking away; removal, withdrawal, or theft (now chiefly formal).
   - Example: The unauthorized abstraction of funds triggered an audit.

5) Distraction or absorption of the mind; absent-mindedness (now somewhat archaic).
   - Example: He sat in abstraction, unaware of the bustle around him.

6) Art. The process or result of reducing representation to essential forms, often dispensing with realistic depiction; abstract art or an abstract work.
   - Example: The exhibition traces the rise of geometric abstraction in the 20th century.

7) Mathematics and logic. The formation of structures by identifying and retaining only essential properties and relations, disregarding specific instances.
   - Example: Group theory arises from the abstraction of symmetry operations.

8) Computing and information systems. A design principle: focusing on essential features while concealing unnecessary implementation details, so components can be understood and used via well-defined interfaces.
   - Typical benefits: managing complexity, enabling reuse, and allowing safe change because dependencies run through interfaces rather than internal steps.
   - Example: Developers use an abstraction layer to call a database without knowing its storage engine.

9) Chemistry and physics. The removal of a component (e.g., proton abstraction); extraction.
   - Example: Base-catalyzed proton abstraction initiates the reaction.

Historical development (brief)
- Medieval philosophy: From Latin abstractio, the intellect’s operation of drawing universals from particulars (Aristotelian and Scholastic traditions).
- Early modern usage: Broadened to mental withdrawal and to removal in general (including legal/financial “abstraction” = taking away).
- 19th–20th centuries: Strong emergence in aesthetics (non-figurative art); solidification in mathematics and logic as method and product of generalization.
- Mid–late 20th century to present: Central in computing and systems engineering as a foundational design strategy (data abstraction, procedural abstraction, object abstraction, APIs, virtualization, layers, models).

Stakeholder/contextual uses
- Philosophers: The operation by which universals are formed; debates over realism vs nominalism.
- Logicians/mathematicians: Method for defining structures by axioms; moving from concrete instances to formal systems.
- Artists/critics: Degree of non-representational form; movements such as Abstract Expressionism, geometric abstraction.
- Psychologists/cognitive scientists: Cognitive ability to generalize across instances; levels of representation; abstraction in concept learning.
- Chemists/physicists: Specific removal processes (e.g., hydrogen abstraction).
- Software engineers/architects: Interfaces, layers, modules; encapsulation; API design; modeling; abstraction barriers.
- Product managers/UX designers: Simplifying user interaction by hiding complexity; conceptual models; progressive disclosure.
- Data scientists/ML engineers: Feature abstraction, embeddings, model interfaces, schema design; abstraction for reproducibility.
- Legal/financial professionals: Formal term for unauthorized removal of assets; “abstraction” as misappropriation.

Extended examples by sense
1) Mental separation: Through abstraction, she set aside the anecdotes and focused on the underlying mechanism.
2) Abstractedness: The report’s level of abstraction makes it portable across teams.
3) Abstract (concept): Freedom is an abstraction that resists precise definition.
4) Removal/theft: The investigation uncovered the systematic abstraction of client funds.
5) Absorption of mind: Lost in abstraction, he missed his stop.
6) Art: Her late work moves toward bold color fields and near-total abstraction.
7) Math/logic: Category theory is a further abstraction of structures and mappings found across mathematics.
8) Computing: - Calling a function is an act of procedural abstraction; the caller need not see the code.
   - A class provides data abstraction by exposing behavior while hiding representation.
   - An API abstracts a service so clients depend on a contract, not internals.
9) Chemistry/physics: Radical abstraction of a hydrogen atom propagates the chain reaction.

Notes on usage and nuance
- Count vs mass: “an abstraction” (a specific concept or model) vs “abstraction” (the process/degree). 
- Level of abstraction: often used comparatively to indicate granularity (higher-level vs lower-level views).
- Collocations: degree/level of abstraction; abstraction layer; data/procedural/object abstraction; pure abstraction; geometric abstraction; abstraction from particulars; abstraction of funds.
