Here are three multiple-choice exam questions on algorithmic bias.

1) Which statement best describes algorithmic bias?
- A. Random errors caused by software bugs
- B. Consistent unfair advantages or disadvantages produced by a system for certain people or groups
- C. Differences in user preferences across demographics
- D. Any inaccurate prediction made by a model
Correct answer: B
Explanation: Algorithmic bias refers to systematic unfairness affecting specific groups.

2) A company’s hiring tool shows higher pass rates for men than for equally qualified women. Which action is the most appropriate first step to reduce bias?
- A. Increase the model’s overall accuracy using more features
- B. Remove all demographic variables from the model and redeploy immediately
- C. Evaluate performance across demographic groups and audit the training data for imbalance and proxies
- D. Replace the model with a different algorithm without reviewing data or outputs
Correct answer: C
Explanation: Bias reduction begins with measuring group-wise performance and auditing datasets for imbalance and proxy features.

3) Which combination correctly pairs a real-world domain with a suitable bias-mitigation practice?
- A. Loan approvals — limit transparency to prevent users from gaming the system
- B. Facial recognition — document datasets, expand representation, and test error rates by demographic group
- C. Predictive policing — train solely on historical arrest data to ensure consistency
- D. Hiring — remove all human oversight to avoid subjective judgment
Correct answer: B
Explanation: Bias mitigation involves better dataset documentation/coverage and group-wise evaluation; predictive policing and hiring require more oversight, not less.
